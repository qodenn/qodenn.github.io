            <h3 class="hecho">Widespread Plastics Found In Food</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                A new report that tested 85 foods found that all but one contained phthalates, a chemical used to make plastic more durable, and 79% had BPA, another chemical found in plastic.<br><br>

                Consumer Reports observed the highest phthalate levels were in Annie's Organic Cheesy Ravioli, with other significant amounts in various products from Del Monte, Chicken of the Sea, and fast-food chains like Wendy's and McDonald's. For instance, Wendy's Crispy Chicken Nuggets contained four times as many phthalates as McDonald's Chicken McNuggets.<br><br>

                “That tells us that, as widespread as these chemicals are, there are ways to reduce how much is in our foods,” said James Rogers, who oversees Consumer Reports' product safety testing.<br><br>

                No tested levels exceeded current U.S. and European regulatory limits. However, there's no universally acknowledged safe level for phthalates, raising concerns about the potential health risks.<br><br>

                Companies like Gerber and McDonald's claim to follow regulatory requirements and conduct rigorous testing, while others, like Del Monte, note that phthalates are widespread in the environment.

            <h3 class="hecho">Trump Responds To Epstein Files</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                A spokesperson for Trump has responded after the former president was named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that were unsealed last night, saying any claims about Trump’s relationship with Epstein have been “thoroughly debunked.”<br><br>

                The documents contain a deposition from an Epstein accuser who claims she traveled from Florida to Atlantic City with Epstein and went to one of the Trump's casinos. When the accuser was asked if she ever massaged Trump, she responded twice that she never had. It’s important to emphasize that individuals named in the documents are not necessarily accused of wrongdoing, and Trump has not been linked to any offenses committed by Epstein.<br><br>

                Trump flew on Epstein's jet four times in 1993, as well as once in 1994, 1995, and 1997. Documents released in 2019 involving an Epstein witness suggest Trump had never visited Epstein’s island or homes.<br><br>

                In 2018, an attorney who represented a number of Epstein accusers said Trump was the only high-profile figure who sounded the alarm on Epstein before he was charged.<br><br>

                Bradley Edwards, attorney: “The only thing I can say about President Trump is that he is the only person who in 2009, when I served a lot of subpoenas on a lot of people, or at least gave notice to some pretty connected people that I wanted to talk to them, he is the only person who picked up the phone and said, ‘Lets just talk, I'll give you as much time as you want, I'll tell you what you need to know.’”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                An Australian real estate agent went to court after being tricked into buying 30,000 Australian dollars ($20,000) worth of fake Air Jordan 1 sneakers from a teenager, including the coveted Dior collaboration.<br><br>

                The buyer spotted defects shortly after the purchase and had the shoes authenticated at a local Melbourne store, where they were confirmed as fakes, including “Bred,” “Chicago,” and “Royal” colorways of the Air Jordan 1.<br><br>

                One staff member at the local store said the seller “was a fraudster and a scam artist who had been blacklisted.”<br><br>

                The seller's father offered $6,773 AUD in compensation, but the buyer escalated the matter to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, seeking full reimbursement. The tribunal dismissed the case because the seller was underage at the time of the transaction, and under Victorian state law, is not liable to offer any compensation.<br><br>

                VCAT member Katherine Metcalf: “Had the agreement been entered into when [the seller] was 18 years old, the result might have been different.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Biden’s unwavering support of Israel has led to internal disagreement and criticism, with a senior education official resigning.<br><br>

                Policy advisor Tariq Habash wrote in his resignation letter: “I cannot stay silent as this administration turns a blind eye to the atrocities committed against innocent Palestinian lives, in what leading human rights experts have called a genocidal campaign by the Israeli government.”<br><br>

                A group of 17 Biden campaign staffers published an anonymous letter criticizing his approach to the conflict, demanding a ceasefire and steps to address “apartheid, occupation, and ethnic cleansing.” Biden has yet to call for a ceasefire as over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began its military actions in Gaza.<br><br>

                “As your staff, we believe it is both a moral and electoral imperative for you to publicly call for a cessation of violence,” the staffers wrote. “Complicity in the death of over 20,000 Palestinians, 8,200 of whom are children, simply cannot be justified.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                NYC Mayor Eric Adams claimed New York is doing much better than Los Angeles' Skid Row in terms of homelessness and crime, holding up an unflattering photo of LA as evidence during a press conference.<br><br>

                “You don’t see this in New York,” Adams said, holding up a picture of LA’s crowded streets, “Not while I'm mayor. It's not going to happen.”<br><br>

                Adams made the statement while discussing year-end crime statistics, which show a 0.032% decrease from the previous year, despite rising motor vehicle theft and assault rates. The mayor has warned NYC’s migration crisis could lead to more street homelessness and credits his administration's efforts, including a homeless encampment task force.<br><br>

                Critics and observers note that NYC still faces significant challenges with homelessness and crime, with the situation exacerbated by the pandemic and an influx of migrants.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A CEO of a cryptocurrency hedge fund has been accused of being a “fake person” after the company's collapse led to $1.3 billion in customer losses.<br><br>

                Steven Reece Lewis, the alleged CEO of HyperVerse, could not have his existence verified by The Guardian. No records at the universities Lewis seemingly attended or at former employers like Goldman Sachs and Adobe were found.<br><br>

                Notably, celebrities like Chuck Norris and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak endorsed Lewis in 2022 as CEO. They remain silent on the new accusations and some believe they might have been hired through the video-for-hire platform Cameo and had been “innocently misled.”<br><br>

                In 2022, Andrew Penman, a writer for the British paper The Mirror, suggested: “I suspect that he’s a figment of someone’s imagination, created to give a false sense of security to this sham. I can find no record of such a person other than a Twitter account started last year, and HyperVerse has refused to answer my questions about him or even give me an email address so that I can put questions to him directly.”

                Luxury brand Hermès is now selling a single paper envelope for about $125. The signature A5 orange envelope measures 8.26 inches by 5.82 inches, is wrapped in silk, reusable, and made in France. It's marketed as a special keepsake for invitations or declarations of love.<br><br>

                Even better, the Barenia calfskin version retails for $5,150, and the collection also features a $405 mouse pad and a $780 mail tray to hold the envelopes. Hermès has a $2,950 paperweight as well.<br><br>

                “This keepsake can be sent as a special invitation or even a declaration of love. A long-lasting way to turn your records into beautiful memories,” reads the description on the Hermès UK site.<br><br>

                “I took out a second mortgage for the mushroom paper weight,” a social media user joked.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Officials are increasingly concerned about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in medical devices like MRIs and pacemakers due to outdated software and potential hacker targeting.<br><br>

                A U.S. government watchdog urged the agencies to improve coordination on medical device cybersecurity, emphasizing the risks these vulnerabilities pose to both hospital networks and patients. The threats could become more pronounced as health systems enhance security against attempts to seize health records. High-value devices like MRIs are particularly at risk.<br><br>

                Existing medical devices on the market lack mandatory cybersecurity measures, and many incorporate vulnerable off-the-shelf software. Hospitals have reported incidents like unauthorized access from remote locations, with manufacturers sometimes unable to provide fixes.<br><br>

                Toby Gouker, an executive at First Health Advisory: “It's a real Achilles' heel and a blind spot for health systems."

                “The honeymoon period of globalization is over,” said MVRDV Asia studio director Wenchian Shi. “Each country and each continent is looking more inward and trying to be more defensive.”<br><br>

                OMA's managing partner David Gianotten agreed, suggesting that "the era of abundance seems to be coming to an end.” “We are facing a shortage of resources,” he added, pointing to global unrest as producing “a sense of insecurity among many of us.” This will lead to "new design approaches" that prioritize local communities, he said.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Researchers in South Korea have developed cutting-edge “nanodrones” to combat cancer by targeting and destroying cancer cells.

                The tiny drones work by using ligands attached to their surface to target specific cells connected to cancer. In lab tests, the drones activated human NK cells to attack cancer, significantly slowing tumor growth in mice without noticeable side effects.

                Sebyung Kang, researcher: “This research presents new possibilities for immune treatment through NK cell delivery nanodrones, overcoming challenges such as the movement and survival of NK cells. We aim to provide new opportunities for customized treatments that selectively address various types of cancer through further research, including cancer-specific immune cell induction.”

                The first of over 150 names connected to Jeffrey Epstein are expected to be unsealed today, The Messenger reports, citing a federal court official.<br><br>

                “The unsealing is expected to begin today,” Ed Friedland, the district executive for the Southern District of New York, told the media outlet.<br><br>

                Likely, the list will include prominent figures whose connections to Epstein are already known, such as former President Bill Clinton, who has been identified as “Doe 36,” and Prince Andrew. Activists hope, however, that new names will emerge.<br><br>

                Notably, three names on the list will be sealed until January 22, Mediaite reported. This delay was requested by an unidentified “John Doe 107,” citing a risk of physical harm and hate mail received.

            <h3 class="hecho">Study: Vegan Food Is Not Healthier</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                A study of nearly 2,000 meals from 50 fast food chains across five countries revealed that vegan options aren't necessarily lower in calories compared to meat-based meals.<br><br>

                The plant-based meals were found to have less protein and sodium but more carbohydrates and sugar, challenging the common perception that all vegan fast-food options are a healthier choice.<br><br>

                Mikołaj Kamiński, lead author from the Poznań University of Medical Sciences: “Our findings revealed that plant-based fast-food meals were more likely to contain more carbohydrates and sugar than meat-based equivalents. Surprisingly, our study shows that plant-based meals are not associated with lower calories, which consumers may not realize.” <br><br>

                “This really emphasizes the importance of making informed food choices, especially when it comes to consuming fast food—even more so if you suffer from a metabolic disorder like type 2 diabetes. It exposes the illusion that plant-based alternatives of popular fast-food dishes are automatically a healthier choice.”<br><br>

                The study also noted that meat-based meals are more likely to contain allergens such as dairy and eggs, while plant-based meals may have allergens like sesame, seeds, and nuts.

            <h3 class="hecho">Driverless Cars Immune From Tickets</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                In California, police have been instructed that autonomous vehicles cannot be penalized for traffic tickets, though they can receive parking violations.<br><br>

                The reason is both simple and indicative of how far technology has come: current state law mandates there be a driver for traffic tickets to be written. This legal gap has raised concerns, as incidents like a Cruise robo-taxi striking a pedestrian in 2018 demonstrate the potential risks of driverless cars.<br><br>

                Other states like Texas and Arizona have updated laws to hold operators of autonomous vehicles accountable for traffic violations, even if no one is behind the wheel. The California DMV stated it could establish requirements to ensure the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, but no specific actions have been taken yet.<br><br>

                San Francisco's Police Chief Bill Scott: “Technology evolves rapidly and, at times, faster than legislation or regulations can adapt to the changes.”

                A court filing accuses the Church of Scientology of operating as a “criminal enterprise” and engaging in “a pattern of racketeering activity” that violates laws targeting Mafia activity.<br><br>

                The allegations stem from the rape accusers of Danny Masterson, a Scientologist and actor. In September, he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for the rape of two women.<br><br>

                Three more rape claims have since been alleged, and they now involve the Church of Scientology at large and its leader, David Miscavige. The original lawsuit, filed nearly five years ago, claimed the accusers were targeted by the Church after they contacted the LAPD with their rape claims against Masterson.<br><br>

                The new lawsuit: “While presenting itself outwardly as a respectable organization, Scientology's criminal enterprise has implemented a policy of terrorizing victims (and witnesses) of its crimes—whether or not those victims (or witnesses) are Scientologists—into keeping Scientology's crimes secret.”<br><br>

                “This begins by inculcating its members to distrust outsiders, and particularly to distrust governmental enforcement. Scientology's criminal enterprise has a strict policy against reporting crimes to the authorities, and if a member does find the courage to go to the authorities, Scientology's criminal enterprise and its agents engage in a coordinated effort to wreak havoc on the victim's life through a targeted harassment campaign,” it adds.<br><br>

                A spokesperson for the Church told Deadline: “The allegations about the Church are complete fabrications and the litigation nothing but an attempted money grab.”<br><br>

                Scientology was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard. It affirms the existence of a higher deity without defining its nature, and it asserts that humans are immortal and possess infinite capabilities, among other beliefs. Prominent Scientologists include Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and Vivian Kubrick, the daughter of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Western sanctions have yet to force Russia to end the war in Ukraine, partly due to a misunderstanding of Russia's economic structure.<br><br>

                Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev argues that the West's assumption of Russia as a rigid, state-run economy is flawed and that it's more of a market economy.<br><br>

                Private sectors in Russia have adapted rapidly, redirecting trade like oil exports from Europe to Asia and developing new supply chains to avoid sanctions.<br><br>

                Russia's economy reportedly grew by 5.5% in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to see continued growth, although growth is expected to slow to 1.1% due to high-interest rates.<br><br>

                Vladislav Inozemtsev, Russian economist: “The main mistake of Western experts and politicians was to create fairy tales that the entire Russian economy is state-run. But that was a mistake, because the Russian economy is very much a market economy… No one would say that the American economy was a war economy.”

                Over 450 individuals involved in the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, have received a combined total of 847 years in prison as of late 2023.<br><br>

                Sentences ranged from a few days to a record 22 years, with one defendant receiving the lightest penalty of six days, intermittently on weekends.<br><br>

                Despite not even being in Washington during the riot, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio had the heaviest sentence at 22 years for organizing more than 200 to breach the Capitol, being convicted of seditious conspiracy.<br><br>

                The Department of Justice and FBI continue their investigations at an “unprecedented speed and scale,” with 1,237 arrests made so far.<br><br>

                The most common charges have included entering a restricted federal building, obstruction, assault, destruction of property, and possession of deadly weapons.<br><br>

                Department of Justice officials: “The Department of Justice’s resolve to hold accountable those who committed crimes on January 6, 2021, has not, and will not, wane.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Social media is popularizing “birth tourism,” where expecting mothers travel abroad to give birth and reap benefits like citizenship and better healthcare. Critics label the trend as “tone deaf” and “ignorant,” citing concerns about immigration laws.<br><br>

                The trend is based on a legal principle called jus soli, or the law of the soil, which grants citizenship to all people born in the nation. Some nations, like the U.S., follow this policy, while others require the parents to also be citizens. Former President Trump has pledged to abolish the policy, often called birthright citizenship, if re-elected.<br><br>

                One woman wrote on TikTok: “Join my email list and learn how to get an extra passport! My guide to birthright citizenship is coming soon.”<br><br>

                Akua Ohenetwene Aboagye, U.S. immigration attorney: “They are treating U.S. citizenship like a commodity, like something that can be bought. The U.S. government does not like that because they want to make sure it maintains its integrity. It’s not something that you can just purchase off of the market.”<br><br>

                She added: “They provide fictitious bank statements, they coach people how to lie at their immigration interviews. They just show them how to just pretty much avoid following the rules so that they can get what they are looking for, which is ultimately U.S. citizenship for their children. Once you try to sidestep these rules, then you will get a bad history because it’s going to be noted on your immigration record, so you are just going to be pretty much barred from entering the U.S.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The UK is planning to expand its already extensive surveillance laws with a new bill that industry executives and activists say will infringe on efforts to protect user privacy.<br><br>

                The bill, which is amending the landmark Investigatory Powers Act, would prevent tech companies from making updates that would make it harder for information to be shared with the government.<br><br>

                Industry body TechUK argues that the changes would “grant a de facto power to indefinitely veto companies from making changes to their products and services offered in the U.K.”<br><br>

                “Using this power, the government could prevent the implementation of new end-to-end encryption, or stop developers from patching vulnerabilities in code that the government or their partners would like to exploit,” Meredith Whittaker, president of secure messaging app Signal, told POLITICO.<br><br>

                Tech companies, including Apple, WhatsApp, and Signal, have threatened to withdraw their services from the UK if the bill undermines encryption standards. The government insists the amendments are merely technical tweaks.<br><br>

                Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch: “What we're seeing across these different bills is a continual edging further towards … turning private tech companies into arms of a surveillance state.”

                The mayor of Denver announced that the city reached his promise of housing 1,000 homeless people by the end of 2023. For the new year, he’s inaugurated the city's first “micro-community,” which has already housed 54 people.<br><br>

                The community features shelters developed by the company Pallet, which include beds, desks, and storage, along with community amenities like laundry, bathrooms, and pet care.<br><br>

                Despite concerns from local residents about potential increases in crime and decreased property values, the city is optimistic, planning more micro-communities to open this year.<br><br>

                Mike Johnston, mayor: “That is the spirit of what these folks put in. Not just because they believed in the mission, but because they believe in the neighbors that they needed them to deliver these sites on time so no one had to go into New Year’s and stay outside in the cold.”<br><br>

                Amy King, CEO of Pallet: “We're really grateful at Pallet to be part of what's happening here. We have over 120 sites across the country.  And we're really excited about this one here, considering the volume of the crisis here.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The Daily Mail asked two leading AI chatbots for 2024 predictions. Above all, they anticipated significant advancements in technology, including the emergence of AI that can rival human intelligence.<br><br>

                Google’s Bard and Amazon’s Claude were used to make the predictions, as they have access to current information, unlike ChatGPT.<br><br>

                Claude foresees AI models beginning to show signs of artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning that software can represent generalized human cognitive abilities.<br><br>

                Claude: “In recent years we've seen AI algorithms match or exceed human performance in specialized tasks like object recognition, game playing, and language processing. Groups like DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Brain, and Anthropic are pushing towards this goal of AGI. While we likely won't fully crack general intelligence by 2024, we might see demos of systems that start displaying more expansive reasoning, creativity, and decision-making abilities.”<br><br>

                Bard predicts that biotechnology will “upgrade” humans, especially through breakthroughs like brain-computer interfaces. Elon Musk’s Neuralink is set to test such technology in volunteers in the coming year. The AI also anticipates personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the individual based on their DNA.<br><br>

                In geopolitics, Claude expects tensions between the U.S. and China to intensify. This will likely come because of China’s increasing military actions in Taiwan, the tool warns: “Taiwan has evolved into a distinct, democratic society with its own identity. The U.S. has historically supported Taiwan's right to self-determination and supplied arms for its defenses, raising tensions with China.”

                Only 15% of Israelis support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu staying in office after the war in Gaza ends, a poll published today found.<br><br>

                His political rival, centrist Benny Gantz, garnered support from 23% of the respondents, with 30% having no preference.<br><br>

                Wide-spread criticism of Netanyahu has been observed for quite some time. In October, a poll found that 80% of Israelis believe he must take responsibility for the security failures exposed by Hamas’ attack on Israel.<br><br>

                This decline reflects a continuous decrease in birth rates, with 2005 and 2022 marking record lows in the country's total fertility rate.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Middle-aged women are increasingly exploring kinks and fantasies, according to the founder of one of the UK’s largest sex-positive communities.<br><br>

                Emma Sayle, who organizes extravagant balls and sex parties for adults, says there is a growing appetite for sexual adventure among the UK population, but especially among women wanting to prioritize themselves.<br><br>

                “We find a lot of women are leaving marriages, or their husbands have left, they’ve had kids and suddenly they’re in their late 30s, early 40s, even 50s, going: ‘Hang on a minute, it’s time for me to be unapologetically selfish and recognize I’m a human being with needs and desires,’” she says.<br><br>

                She adds: “I think there’s a realization that you’re not on the shelf when you’re 40 or 50—you can be 70 and still have a sex life, still go out and experiment and explore and date or try new things sexually.”<br><br>

                For instance, these women are happy to spend €175 ($192) for a ticket to this year’s Venice Carnival Ball, which promises the “ultimate erotic masquerade experience in Italy’s floating city.”<br><br>

                “This is not a generation of women who have relied on their husband for finances,” Sayle notes. “If women are financially independent, that kind of channels into every other aspect of our lives, it gives us control over everything else.”

                48% of British teenagers say they feel addicted to social media, according to a new study.<br><br>

                The University of Cambridge tracked the lives of about 19,000 people born in 2000-2002. When the cohort was aged 16-18, they were asked for the first time about social media use.<br><br>

                Of the 7,000 people who responded, 48% said they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I think I am addicted to social media.” A higher proportion of girls (57%) agreed compared to boys (37%).<br><br>

                Scientists emphasized that this does not mean teens are actually suffering from a clinical addiction, but that expressing a perceived lack of control suggests a problematic relationship.<br><br>

                Georgia Turner, a graduate student leading the analysis: “Self-perceived social media addiction is not [necessarily] the same as drug addiction. But it’s not a nice feeling to feel you don’t have agency over your own behavior. It’s quite striking that so many people feel like that and it can’t be that good.”<br><br>

                Last week, a Harvard study found that social media companies made $11 billion in U.S. ad revenue from minors in 2022.

                Hilke Schellmann warns in her book “The Algorithm” that AI tools used in HR range from résumé screeners to personality assessments analyzing facial expressions and social media behavior. Despite the potential for AI to save companies money and time, she says there's a lack of proof that these tools find the most successful candidates, and they might be prone to biases.<br><br>

                To test this, she posed as a prospective job hunter. One tool rated her as a high match for a job even though she spoke nonsense to it in German. A personality assessment algorithm gave her high marks for “steadiness” based on her Twitter use and a low rating based on her LinkedIn profile.<br><br>

                Schellmann: “I think all employers hope that these tools will find the most successful candidates, but we do not have a lot of proof that they do. We have seen employers save a lot of money on labor. I think that's often all they want.”

                Officials in Bologna have announced a €4.3 million ($4.71 million) restoration plan to secure and repair the 47-meter-tall Garisenda Tower that leans at a four-degree angle, similar to its more famous counterpart, the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

                Heritage restoration was a main theme in architecture last year, marked by buildings facing the threat of demolition, sometimes saved through the collective effort of communities aware of their cultural and environmental impact.

                People can now creatively reuse the Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie.” Examples include incorporating clips in an art project or selling a T-shirt reproducing a frame. But if those items infringe on the overall trademark of Mickey Mouse, Disney can still sue.<br><br>

                A 7.6 magnitude earthquake has hit Japan on the first day of 2024, sending tsunami waves along the country’s west coast.<br><br>

                Within 90 minutes, 21 quakes above 4.0 magnitude occurred, leaving thousands homeless or without power. Videos of the devastating aftermath quickly made the rounds on social media, showing evacuations, fires, destroyed homes, and collapsed buildings.<br><br>

                A tsunami threat was also announced in eastern Russian cities, without any evacuations reported yet.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Generation Alpha, born between 2010-2024, is considered the first fully online generation and is expected to exceed two billion people, making it the largest generation in history.<br><br>

                Known as “iPad kids,” they have grown up with advanced technology, like the iPhone and TikTok, as a norm. COVID significantly shaped their upbringing, leading to increased online learning and socializing. Access to tools like ChatGPT AI and Siri at a young age has only intensified their reliance on technology for education.<br><br>

                MaryLeigh Bliss, chief content officer at YPulse: “They're having a media-centric childhood in a way that is different because of the kinds of media they're interacting with from incredibly young ages.”<br><br>

                Others are optimistic. Mark McCrindle, a social researcher, says, “Alphas bring a sense of empathy because they are connected globally to the issues of their world.”<br><br>

                Millennial parents give kids their first smartphones at about nine years old, researchers have found. 79% of these parents say their children are on social media, and 44% note their kids watch video content on a smartphone at least weekly. Nearly half (43%) of the parents also say their children have had a virtual playdate or hung out with friends in virtual spaces.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                California is seeing a significant exodus of its high-earning and well-educated populace, The Los Angeles Times notes, reversing a long-standing trend.<br><br>

                For years, thousands of individuals in this demographic have been leaving rather than arriving, drawn away by lower taxes and a more affordable cost of living in other states.<br><br>

                In 2021 and 2022, about 750,000 more people left the state than moved in, according to new released Census Bureau data. In that time, more than 250,000 Californians with at least a bachelor’s degree moved out, while an average of 175,000 college graduates from other states settled in California, according to an analysis of the data.<br><br>

                In prior decades, that balance was about even or slightly in California’s favor.<br><br>

                As a result, the state is struggling with a record $68 billion deficit due to a 25% drop in personal income tax collection last year. There are other factors driving this, such as a slow stock market and layoffs in the tech sector, but the increasing emigration of professionals is certainly causing an impact.<br><br>

                The migration pattern is particularly strong among those aged 35 to 44, largely driven by California's severe housing affordability crisis. The median price of a single-family house in the state was $840,360 in October, up 46% since early 2020.<br><br>

                Joel Kotkin, fellow at Chapman University: “There’s a price to pay for the movement of middle- and upper-income people and corporations. People who are leaving are taking their tax dollars with them.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The war in Gaza is not expected to wrap up any time soon, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said yesterday.<br><br>

                Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that the Israeli military is making adjustments to its deployment of troops in the Gaza Strip as it anticipates the war lasting for the entirety of 2024.<br><br>

                Hagari: “We are adjusting the fighting methods to each area in Gaza, as well as the necessary forces to carry out the mission in the best way possible. Each area has different characteristics and different operational needs.”<br><br>

                The official added that as 2024 begins, “The goal of the war requires lengthy fighting, and we are prepared accordingly.”<br><br>

                The conflict, nearing three months, has resulted in at least 21,822 deaths in Gaza and 1,200 in Israel. Hamas media claims 8,000 Palestinian children have been murdered by Israeli troops.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia saw a dramatic rise in global influence in 2023, largely spurred by control over the oil market, diplomatic power, and investments in avenues like entertainment and futuristic cities.<br><br>

                Back in 2020, the desert kingdom faced global isolation. Biden called Mohammed bin Salman a “pariah” for the death of an American journalist, while the EU urged an arms embargo on the nation.<br><br>

                Since then, the kingdom has used its influence over oil to rise beyond expectations. “Saudi Arabia's centrality in the world oil market is the centerpiece of Saudi global influence,” said international relations professor F. Gregory Gause.<br><br>

                The country has also leveraged its location in the Middle East in diplomatic strategies. The Crown Prince’s efforts include negotiations, brokered by the U.S., to normalize relations with Israel, and an easing of tensions with Iran.<br><br>

                Guided by his Vision 2030, Mohammed bin Salman ultimately seeks to move his nation away from a reliance on fossil fuels to become a global leader in technology and innovation. In November, the country was named the host of the 2030 World Expo, beating Italy and South Korea. This global exhibition will attract billions in investment and thousands of visitors to the desert kingdom.<br><br>

                Saudi Arabia has also invested billions in PGA golf, hosted heavyweight boxing tournaments, and continued construction of its futuristic megacity Neom, which will include a man-made mountain and be 17 times the size of London.

                2024 will see a rise in failures for big firms amid high borrowing costs and pressure on consumer budgets, analysts say.<br><br>

                Construction and business services saw the highest insolvency rates in 2023, signaling continued vulnerability. Hospitality and retail were also heavily impacted by rising energy costs and borrowing expenses.<br><br>

                David Kelly, head of insolvency, PwC: “We are expecting these areas to remain the hardest hit in 2024.”<br><br>

                High-growth companies, particularly in the tech sector, may face significant challenges as funding dries up. <br><br>

                Rob Hornby, partner, AlixPartners: “We are expecting next year to be a big year for insolvency. That is likely to be across the board, both in terms of geographies and sectors. I personally think we are definitely seeing an element of the dotcom bubble repeating itself. Since before the pandemic, there was plenty of investment money around, with venture capitalists worried about missing out. You ended up with some areas of tech, for example, where you had more competitors funded in one space than were ever likely to succeed sustainably in the longer term. Now some of that funding is running dry, you will start to see consequences.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists are exploring “exercise mimetics,” drugs or injections that replicate some of the benefits of exercise.<br><br>

                A landmark experiment in Norway is testing the effects of injecting exercised plasma into older adults with early-stage Alzheimer’s. The hormone irisin, released during exercise, shows promise in clearing toxic plaques in the brain related to Alzheimer’s.<br><br>

                The main target for these drugs is disabled and elderly patients, but they may also benefit the general population on busy days.<br><br>

                Researchers are moving slowly and cautiously because of the risk of unpleasant or even dangerous side-effects that have intercepted various previous attempts to turn exercise into a drug.<br><br>

                Andrew Budson, professor of neurology at Boston University: “I think there’s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of trying to replicate the physiologically beneficial effects of exercise. I have no problem with that. I happen to enjoy my exercise and I don’t think that I would give it up, but on a busy day, I think it would be great to [be able to] take a drug instead of missing out on the health benefits of exercise completely.”

                The Biden administration bypassed Congress twice this month to fast-track emergency weapons sales to Israel, totaling over $253 million. This includes a $147.5 million sale for equipment to operationalize 155 mm shells and a $106 million sale of tank ammunition.<br><br>

                Secretary of State Antony Blinken invoked emergency authority to expedite these sales, citing “the urgency of Israel's defensive needs.”<br><br>

                Amid concerns over civilian casualties in Gaza, the State Department has emphasized its ongoing communication with Israel to minimize harm and uphold international humanitarian law.<br><br>

                The moves coincide with a stalled $106 billion aid request for Ukraine, Israel, and other U.S. security interests in Congress, partly due to debates over immigration policy and the border.<br><br>

                Secretary of State Antony Blinken: “Given the urgency of Israel's defensive needs, the secretary notified Congress that he had exercised his delegated authority to determine an emergency existed necessitating the immediate approval of the transfer.”

                Despite legal consequences for the Jan. 6, 2021, protestors, over 100 members of Congress who challenged the 2020 election results were reelected, and several attendees of the “Stop the Steal” rally have gained legislative seats.<br><br>

                The study found that many Americans prefer leaders who promise protection by any means, including violating democratic principles, with a significant number favoring “bending the rules to get things done.”<br><br>

                11% of strong Democrats “strongly agree,” while 21% “agree.”<br><br>

                21% of strong Republicans “strongly agree,” while 46% “agree.”<br><br>

                In Xi Jinping’s New Year's address, the Chinese President emphasized that the “reunification” of Taiwan with China is “a historical inevitability,” as Taiwan prepares for its presidential and parliamentary elections.<br><br>

                China considers Taiwan to be its “sacred territory,” ramping up military pressure, and has not renounced the use of force to achieve reunification, though Xi did not mention military threats in his speech.<br><br>

                The upcoming elections in Taiwan are occurring amid heightened tensions, with China labeling the presidential candidate for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Party (DPP), Lai Ching-te, as a "dangerous separatist" and a "destroyer of peace across the Taiwan Strait."<br><br>

                The DPP, led by current President Tsai Ing-wen and presidential candidate Lai, promotes the idea that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, a stance that clashes with Beijing's claim over the island.<br><br>

                Xi Jinping: “The reunification of the motherland is a historical inevitability. Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”<br><br>

                Chen Binhua, Spokesperson, China's Taiwan Affairs Office: “His words were full of confrontational thinking. As the leading figure of the DPP authorities and current DPP chairman, Lai Ching-te cannot escape his responsibility for [promoting separatism].”

                The study used CDC data from 1999-2020 to find national trends and regional disparities. States like Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, which have been severely affected by the opioid crisis, all had significant spikes in death rates from the heart condition.<br><br>

                Dr. Sudarshan Balla: “Our study findings raise a public health concern, especially since the deaths in younger age groups are on the rise. We speculate that this acceleration was likely, in the most part, due to the opioid crisis that has engulfed several states and involved principally younger adults.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                U.S. prosecutors will not pursue a second trial against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, citing the comprehensive evidence already presented in the first trial where he was found guilty of all seven criminal counts.<br><br>

                Bankman-Fried, who was convicted in November of charges including wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering, faces over 100 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for March 28.<br><br>

                The second trial was planned to address an additional set of criminal counts, including conspiracy to bribe foreign officials, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and substantive securities fraud and commodities fraud.<br><br>

                Renato Mariotti, former prosecutor: “I wouldn't be surprised if SBF spends the next 20 or 25 years of his life in prison. The sheer scale of his fraud was immense, he was defiant and lied on the witness stand, and Judge Kaplan had very little patience for his antics while out on bond. He will have more sympathy for the victims than he has for Bankman-Fried.”

                Police in Switzerland have ramped up surveillance at a top university following suspicions of Chinese espionage.<br><br>

                Administrators at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne say Chinese men would spend their days in the library, remaining discreet and never appearing to leave. Then one day, they completely disappeared, never to be seen again.<br><br>

                When an employee asked the men what they were doing, one of them said China had sent them on scholarships to write their doctoral theses, and that they would return to their homeland.<br><br>

                Officials noted this suspicious behavior involving Chinese nationals has been seen elsewhere. In one case, a Chinese student interning at a start-up randomly disappeared overnight. To this day, he remains physically untraceable.<br><br>

                Asia researcher Ariane Knüsel says she’s come across examples in which Chinese intelligence asked scientists to specifically work in European industries where China needed intelligence. “The pressure from the Chinese intelligence service on Switzerland has increased massively over the last ten years. China has sent an enormous number of intelligence officers to the West, including to Switzerland,” she said.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A Norwegian study over four decades shows a weakening link between educational attainment and cognitive ability in men.<br><br>

                The researchers note that traditionally, education was a privilege and closely linked to cognitive ability. But as education has become more accessible, this link has diminished, challenging the idea that educational success is correlated with natural intelligence.<br><br>

                The study analyzed males born between 1950 and 1991, using cognitive scores from military conscription and various educational attainment measures, revealing a declining correlation over time.<br><br>

                Arno Van Hootegem, researcher: “The clear trend indicates that educational attainment is weakening over time as a signal of cognitive ability.”<br><br>

                Ole Røgeberg, researcher: “The correlation remains moderate to strong in recent cohorts and cognitive ability remains coupled to educational attainment, but the clear trend indicates that educational attainment is weakening over time as a signal of cognitive ability.”<br><br>

                “An alternative, potentially more plausible explanation for our findings, is the nature of the changing educational and labor market. Education might have become substantially less selective, as educational expansions may have made it generally easier to attain longer education, regardless of cognitive ability,” Røgeberg added.

                Notes referencing JFK, terror attacks, secret societies, and “Lord of the Rings” were found in everyday items like lucky charms and Chai tea, bought from multiple stores in northeastern Pennsylvania and across the state.<br><br>

                Over a dozen locals reported similar findings, with some also bringing it to light on social media.<br><br>

Scientists emphasize this is the closest a probe has ever been to the Sun, and in intergalactic terms, it will essentially “touch” it.<br><br>

                The probe, which will also be the fastest-ever object made by humans, aims to study the solar corona, revealing the secrets of superheating and solar wind acceleration. Researchers say this is crucial for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth, and to prepare for future crewed missions to the Moon.<br><br>

                Enduring temperatures up to 1,400°C (2,552°F), the probe will use a heat shield for protection during its close encounter, providing unprecedented data from within the corona.<br><br>

                Dr. Nour Raouafi, project scientist: “We are basically almost landing on a star.”<br><br>

                Dr. Nicky Fox, head of science at NASA: “We don't know what we'll find, but we'll be looking for waves in the solar wind associated with the heating.

                Unlike Colorado’s banning of Trump last week, which was decided by the state’s supreme court, the Maine decision was unilaterally made by the state’s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, who is neither a lawyer nor elected democratically.<br><br>

                CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said last night: “Were the processes fair? Do they comport with due process? I think there’s a question there with regard to what Maine did.”<br><br>

                “They heard from one fact witness, a law professor. She based her ruling on a lot of documents, but also YouTube clips, news reports—things that would never pass the bar in normal court.”<br><br>

                Brett Tolman, a former U.S. attorney, wrote on X: “The Colorado decision is poor. Factually and legally unjustifiable. But the Maine @shennabellows unilateral decision is mind-boggling and comical.”<br><br>

                Bellows, for her part, wrote in her decision that she is “mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment.” But she added that she is “also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Pornhub has blocked access in North Carolina ahead of a new state law that will require porn websites to verify user ages.<br><br>

                The law, which was passed in September and takes effect on January 1, doesn’t specify the method of age verification but suggests using a “commercially available database” or other reasonable means. Lawmakers passed the measure to protect minors, citing research that found over half of teens report seeing online porn by age 13.<br><br>

                In a message to users in North Carolina, Pornhub says on its site: “Mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we’ve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place.”<br><br>

                Pornhub added that it supports laws that require age verification on devices, not on individual websites.<br><br>

                In 2022, Louisiana became the first state to pass a law like this, and sites saw traffic drop between 80% and 95%, according to the Free Speech Coalition, a porn industry trade group.<br><br>

                The Biden administration has warned Texas of legal action if the state implements a law that would empower state and local officials to arrest, jail, and prosecute illegal migrants.<br><br>

                The law, signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier this month, would create state-level illegal entry crimes, allowing Texas judges to issue de facto deportation orders. Texas lawmakers say it was passed in response to a weak national response to immigration that has produced the greatest migrant crisis in modern American history.<br><br>

                The Department of Justice wrote in a letter to Governor Abbott: “Because SB 4 is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government's operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement.”<br><br>

                The DOJ emphasized that the law would undermine relations with Mexico and prevent federal officials from enforcing national immigration laws.<br><br>

                Governor Abbott issued a public response in a social media post on Thursday, saying the threat showed “hostility to the rule of law in America,” adding that the White House “not only refuses to enforce current U.S. immigration laws, they now want to stop Texas from enforcing laws against illegal immigration.”

                Her comments come less than a week after Democrat Representative Josh Gottheimer met with Netanyahu while visiting Israel on a U.S. government trip. Two months ago, Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer also met with the Israeli leader.<br><br>

                Representative Tlaib, who is the only Palestinian-American member of Congress, has been critical of Biden’s support for Israel, accusing the president of supporting the “genocide” of Palestinians by backing Israel’s actions in Gaza and not calling for a ceasefire.<br><br>

                In November, she was censured by Congress for posting a video online that included the slogan “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which pro-Israel activists say is a call for the destruction of the Jewish state. Tlaib said she considers it “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.”<br><br>

                Later that month, a Democrat in Michigan, the state Tlaib represents, said he was offered $20 million to run against Tlaib in the upcoming Democrat primary. Democrat Nasser Beydoun said the money came from one of the biggest donors of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

                The tool is set to be rolled out over the next three to six months, meaning 2025 should mark an inflection point for Microsoft. The growing potential led Ives to raise his Microsoft price target to $450 from $425—a potential upside of 21% from current levels.

                A group of women in Mexico who dress as nuns and call themselves the “Sisters of the Valley” are striving to reclaim marijuana from the narcos, hoping to use the drug’s healing power to spread the Gospel.<br><br>

                The sisters frequently post on Instagram, where they show themselves caring for cannabis crops. In the U.S., they've turned their cause into a successful business, earning over $500,000 last year by selling CBD products.<br><br>

                They draw inspiration from a religious movement in the Middle Ages called the Beguines, which was made up of single women and devoted itself to spirituality without taking formal vows.<br><br>

                With the narcos dominating the drug trade in Mexico, the women see themselves at odds with them. “We want to take the plant back from the narcos,” Sister Bernardet said.

                The chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse has been fired over his porn activities with his wife, which included videos of them cooking vegan meals with well-known porn stars.<br><br>

                Joe Gow and his wife promoted their OnlyFans, which includes “fully explicit scenes,” on X under the handle @SexyHappyCouple. The pair had also written two books under pseudonyms about porn.<br><br>

                Gow has refused to apologize, emphasizing that his activities are protected by the First Amendment and that no university resources were used to create the videos.<br><br>

                In 2018, Gow had a pay raise denied after inviting porn star Nina Hartley to speak on campus for $5,000.<br><br>

                The president of Wisconsin’s university system condemned Gow’s actions, and another top official said she was “alarmed and disgusted.”

                Water is increasingly at the center of global conflicts, from Ukraine to the Middle East.<br><br>

                During 2022 and the first half of 2023, 344 instances of water-related conflicts occurred worldwide, according to data compiled by researchers at the Pacific Institute. Their data shows a major uptick in violence incidents driven by the targeting of dams in water systems.<br><br>

                Peter Gleick, the Pacific Institute’s co-founder and senior fellow: “It's very disturbing that in particular attacks on civilian water infrastructure seem to be on the rise. We also see a worrying increase in violence associated with water scarcity worsened by drought, climate disruptions, growing populations, and competition for water.”<br><br>

                Since 2000, there have been over 1,630 water-related conflicts, with a rising trend over the last decade.

                A senior Russian diplomat warned Finland that it would be the “first to suffer” if tensions escalated between Moscow and NATO.<br><br>

                Finland, which borders Russia and maintained a neutral status for decades, joined NATO in April. The move was prompted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and doubled the length of the border that NATO shares with Russia.<br><br>

                At the time, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Putin was opposed to NATO expanding to the east, citing it as a justification for his actions in Ukraine. Stoltenberg said that Putin “is getting exactly the opposite... Finland today, and soon also Sweden will become a full-fledged member of the alliance.”<br><br>

                Russian diplomat Mikhail Ulyanov on Thursday: “They had lived calmly and in peace and suddenly ended up between Russia and NATO as a member of that alliance, but since they are our neighbors, if, God forbid there is some escalation, they will be the first to suffer.”

                Paramount is looking at a sale with Skydance, while Warner and Comcast might merge, amid falling TV ad revenue, increased cord-cutting, and the soaring costs of sports and movies.<br><br>

                Rich Greenfield, Analyst at LightShed Partners: “TV advertising is falling far short, cord-cutting is continuing to accelerate, sports costs are going up and the movie business is not performing. Everything is going wrong that can go wrong. The only thing the companies know how to do to survive is try to merge and cut costs.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Michigan’s Supreme Court has upheld a lower court ruling allowing Trump to remain on the 2024 primary ballot, diverting from Colorado’s decision to ban the former president from the state ballot.<br><br>

                Activists in Michigan alleged Trump incited insurrection on January 6, 2021, and thus was ineligible to run for president under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the argument, noting that no provision in Michigan law requires a presidential candidate “to attest to their legal qualification to hold the office.”<br><br>

                Last week, Colorado ruled that the argument was valid. The Colorado Supreme Court said Trump would not be banned until January 4, pending an overruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>

                Lawsuits opposing Trump's ballot eligibility have been filed in state courts in Oregon, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, as well as federal district courts in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, New York, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

                A new report finds that 37% of business leaders say technology replaced workers in 2023, with 44% reporting that there will be layoffs in 2024 due to AI efficiency.<br><br>

                The report, conducted by ResumeBuilder, evaluated 750 business leaders.<br><br>

                Julia Toothacre, resume and career strategist at ResumeBuilder, emphasized the findings may not be as scary as they seem: “There are still so many traditional organizations and small businesses that do not embrace technology the way that some of the larger companies do.”<br><br>

                A poll from the Daily Mail finds that one in five young Americans have a positive view of Osama Bin Laden, with 30% seeing his ideologies as a “force for good.”<br><br>

                The poll surveyed 1,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29.<br><br>

                Terry Strada, national chair of 9/11 Families United, blames the school system: “What is wrong with our youth? How do they not realize the horrors of terrorism? This is a dangerous and slippery slope to go down.”<br><br>

                Brett Eagleson, 9/11 family member: “The minds of this country’s youth are being perverted by our government's feckless inability to be honest with itself and hold the rightful parties accountable, so we actually have a situation where a significant number of young people are praising the murder and death of our neighbors.”<br><br>

                Notably, this poll comes after bin Laden’s manifesto “Letter to America” went viral on TikTok last month, with young users finding his arguments against America and Israel persuasive.

                A Chinese carmaker is on track to overtake Tesla in global electric vehicle (EV) sales, becoming the new worldwide leader in the market.<br><br>

                The diverse and affordable range of China’s BYD challenges Tesla’s pricier models, analysts say. Government subsidies in China have further fueled the surge.<br><br>

                Bridget McCarthy, head of China operations, Snow Bull Capital: “The competitive landscape of the auto industry has changed. It's no longer about the size and legacy of auto companies; it's about the speed at which they can innovate and iterate. BYD began preparing long ago to be able to do this faster than anyone thought possible, and now the rest of the industry has to race to catch up.”<br><br>

                In November, the European Union’s commission chief warned that Beijing’s government subsidies need to be investigated, saying they may result in “clear overcapacity.” China now rivals Japan for the global leader in passenger car exports, with over one million of the 3.6 million vehicles shipped from the country this year being electric.

                Swatting occurs when someone or multiple individuals call local law enforcement pretending to be someone else, saying they are about to commit a crime, typically involving murder or suicide. The perpetrators tend to use fake phone numbers or other layers of privacy to prevent police from tracking them down.<br><br>

                Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, and Representative Brandon Williams were all targeted on Christmas.<br><br>

                The letter adds that Depardieu is being attacked “in defiance of a presumption of innocence from which he would have benefited, like everyone else, if he weren't the cinema giant he is. When people attack Gérard Depardieu in this way, they are attacking art.”<br><br>

                Notably, the signatories include Depardieu’s former partner, actress Carole Bouquet.<br><br>

                Iraq’s government condemned overnight U.S. airstrikes that killed one serviceman and wounded 18 other people, calling them a “clear hostile act.”<br><br>

                Iraqi sources say the strikes targeted facilities owned by the armed group Kataib Hezbollah, escalating tensions as U.S. forces face increasing attacks in the Middle East.<br><br>

                Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani condemned the U.S. actions as “hostile and non-constructive,” stressing the incidents weaken bilateral relations and violate Iraq's sovereignty. A funeral for Hassan Hammadi al-Amiri, the militant killed in the strike, drew mourners decrying America’s presence.<br><br>

                General Michael Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command: “These strikes are intended to hold accountable those elements directly responsible for attacks on coalition forces in Iraq and Syria and degrade their ability to continue attacks. We will always protect our forces.”

                Putin is showing a new willingness to negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine, The New York Times reports.<br><br>

                The report cites Russian and American sources who say Putin is open to a ceasefire for the first time, entailing freezing of all frontline fighting. American officials note Putin is “satisfied with Russia’s captured territory and ready for an armistice.”<br><br>

                The Russian president wishes to enter negotiations on the basis that Crimea and the Donbass would be fully recognized as Russian territory. Until recently, the West saw this as an impossibility, but reports suggest that U.S. and European officials are warming to the idea, admitting that Moscow has “won” the conflict.<br><br>

                The report comes after the White House warned last week that aid to Ukraine will run out unless Congress approves a new spending bill. The U.S. has approved over $110 billion for the eastern European country since the conflict began in February 2022.

                Known as “MZ gangsters,” these criminals are under 30 and were most of the 1,183 arrested between August and December. Law enforcement notes these “gangsters” prioritize profit and partnerships over older, faction-based criminal structures, with over 40% of the charges involving “intricate/business-type illegal activities," such as running online gambling sites.<br><br>

                While traditional mafia-style groups have diminished due to decades of crackdowns, foreign syndicates like the Triads, Yakuza, and Russian mafia continue to influence the country's criminal landscape.

                The emergence of AI girlfriends is creating a shift in actual human relationships, with experts warning about the long-term effects on society.<br><br>

                These virtual companions are customizable down to the finest detail and offer an idealized partnership. As AI technology advances, the virtual beings are becoming increasingly lifelike, mastering human interactions and emotions, and offering a level of perfection that real relationships can't compete with.<br><br>

                Liberty Vittert, professor of data science: “They look like real people and are shockingly good when it comes to replicating human interactions. Physical AI robots that can satisfy humans emotionally and sexually will become a stark reality in less than ten years. It’s always this perfect relationship for lonely single men, which is very dangerous because it further isolates them from real human connections.”<br><br>

                Analysts note that the emergence of AI girlfriends comes as birthrates are at a historical low and loneliness is already at an all-time high. Additionally, men are already interacting with women less and less—a poll from earlier this year found that 59% of men aged 18 to 25 have not approached a woman in the past year.

            <h3 class="hecho">Americans Are Forgetting To Have Fun</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                An editorial in The Washington Post pointed out something that caught our attention: “Sometime in recent history, possibly around 2004, Americans forgot to have fun, true fun, as though they’d misplaced it like a sock.”<br><br>

                The article explores various evidence for this: there are now podcasts on how to be happy, vacations are often overscheduled with so many activities that relaxation becomes exhaustion, and we’ve become obsessed with social media, turning us into dopamine-seeking guinea pigs.<br><br>

                “I feel like I should be having more fun than I’m actually having,” says Alyssa Alvarez, a 27-year-old social media marketing manager and DJ. “I’m addicted to my phone. You live in this social realm, using it as a social crutch instead of making true connections.”<br><br>

                Alvarez has hired a “party coach” who meets with her biweekly, assigning her podcasts, instructing her to journal, and teaching her how to discover new outlets to have fun.<br><br>

                Evan Cudworth, 37, party coach: “So many people are retreating into their phones, into anxiety. I’m helping people rediscover what fun means to them.”<br><br>

                The editorial blames several factors for this lack of fun plaguing Americans. A culture that prioritizes efficiency, productivity, and prestige over leisure; technological advances that capture our attention and expose our insecurities; and an increased sense of dreariness in the workplace, driven by heightened individualism and decreased trust for each other.<br><br>

                Todd Davis, 66, corporate fun coach: “We go to work and there’s no sense of connection and camaraderie. People feel emotionally disconnected. Healthy conversations are the precursor of fun. We’ve lost the art of communication. Our spirit comes home with us. If you don’t communicate at work, what are you coming home with?”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In a new report, Human Rights Watch accuses Facebook and Instagram parent Meta of “systemic and global” censorship of pro-Palestinian content since the war's onset on October 7.<br><br>

                The report cites over 1,000 instances, including post removals, account bans, interaction restrictions, and “shadow banning” that reduces visibility and reach.<br><br>

                Meta has denied the allegations, calling the systemic censorship claim “misleading.” It cited its human rights due diligence and the complexity of content moderation in a polarized conflict. Still, the company’s oversight board admitted errors, reinstating two significant videos depicting scenes from the war.<br><br>

                The claims come as TikTok, seen as a competitor to Meta, is facing opposite allegations: that it favors pro-Palestinian content. Earlier this month, reports emerged that Jewish tech executives met with TikTok’s CEO to discuss the bias concerns. Some, such as Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, have gone so far as to say that spending time on TikTok increases someone’s likelihood of being “antisemitic” to a significant extent.

                The reason for this is copyright law: U.S. law allows copyright to be held for 95 years, after which it enters the public domain. Modern versions of the iconic character will remain unaffected.<br><br>

                Jennifer Jenkins, director of the Duke Center for the Study of the Public Domain: “This is a big one. It’s generating so much excitement in the copyright community — it’s finally happening.”<br><br>

                The puppy was brought to a vet two years ago, when a doctor discovered the white of his left eye and his lips were both bruised. Three of his upper incisors were also missing and another tooth was broken.<br><br>

                Coombes: “I just felt a connection as soon as he was brought in, as he was in such a state. He hasn’t looked back since—and is having the best of life right now. He enjoys running around the garden and going to the beach. Last year we got him around Christmas but it was such a hectic time for him and he was learning to settle then.

                California Governor Gavin Newsom called the efforts to remove Trump from the California ballot “a political distraction,” saying that “in California, we defeat candidates at the polls.”<br><br>

                His comments come after his lieutenant governor sent a letter to California’s secretary of state on Wednesday requesting options be explored to ban Trump from the state’s presidential ballot. The effort was launched following the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision on Tuesday that Trump is ineligible to run for president because he incited “insurrection” on January 6, 2021, and thus is prohibited from appearing on Colorado’s ballot.<br><br>

                Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis wrote to California’s secretary of state that “California must stand on the right side of history,” adding: “The constitution is clear: you must be 35 years old and not be an insurrectionist.”<br><br>

                Newsom’s remarks embody what many see as his ongoing attempt to appear level-headed to the rest of the country. He’s appeared on Fox News on several occasions this year, suggesting an effort to appeal to conservative voters, perhaps in anticipation of a presidential run in the future.

                Church leaders in Bethlehem, the Palestinian city where Jesus Christ was born, have decided to cancel Christmas celebrations this year due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.<br><br>

                Typically, the historical city is packed with more than three million visitors to celebrate the birth of Christ, replete with celebrations of singers and dangers and fireworks, illuminated by a beautiful tree in the center of the town square. This year, the streets are dark and hushed.<br><br>

                Pastor Munther Isaac told Christianity Today that “nobody was going to celebrate. Nobody is in a mood to celebrate,” because the locals are so horrified by what they say is a genocide committed by Israel in Gaza.<br><br>

                However, Christian leaders in Bethlehem will still praise Christ on Christmas. They say the cancelation of spectacular celebrations will help them focus on the true meaning of Christmas.<br><br>

                Elias Al-Najjar, a youth ministry leader, told a group of children and teenagers: “All these small details that we don’t usually think about. On Christmas, we usually put up decorations and have fun with Christmas trees and lights. But if you look at the real story of Christmas, it was a story of pure hardship. But God didn’t leave Mary and Joseph. And they didn’t leave God. So why should we?”

                The pill, called Vibes, works by vibrating in the stomach for 30 minutes before a meal, triggering stretch receptors that simulate the presence of food. This stimulation sends signals to the brain's hypothalamus via the vagus nerve, altering hormone levels to create a feeling of fullness and decrease hunger.<br><br>

                In tests with pigs, the pill led to a nearly 40% decrease in food consumption.<br><br>

                The researchers envision the pill as a non-invasive, temporary therapy for weight management. Unlike drug-based weight loss methods, the Vibes pill avoids significant side effects and offers a new avenue for non-surgical weight management.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Tucker Carlson released a video on X in which he described Julian Assange, the founder of media watchdog WikiLeaks who is wanted by the U.S. government, as one of the “greatest journalists of our age,” blasting his treatment as a villain by the West.<br><br>

                Carlson noted that in the 2016 presidential election, Assange “upended” the race by publishing internal emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). These emails revealed that Hillary Clinton had rigged the primaries against her opponent, Bernie Sanders. For instance, in one May 2016 email, DNC National Secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote: “Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.”<br><br>

                Democrats claimed the Russian government hacked the emails and then supplied them to Assange, which Carlson said is “a lie.” “The emails had been leaked from within the DNC itself, almost certainly by a disgruntled employee,” Carlson emphasized.<br><br>

                Carlson is likely referring to Seth Rich, an employee of the DNC who was shot twice in the back in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood in July 2016. Assange has hinted in interviews that Rich was the source of the emails.<br><br>

                Rich’s murder was peculiar for several reasons. Police described it as a robbery despite no valuables having been taken, the perpetrators were never apprehended, and the FBI ordered to disclose the information on his work laptop and personal laptop following his death. Activists have demanded transparency for years, to no avail.

As the understanding of the human brain grew, so too did the sophistication of the devices, allowing paralyzed patients to play video games, move robotic arms, and communicate with their minds.<br><br>

                Robert Gaunt, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who studies BCIs: “We are at a stage where there’s been enough demonstrations of feasibility that companies have stepped in to try to make real products and medical devices. Whether or not any of them will be successful is a different story entirely.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Millions of people may have lived in a lost colony that was submerged by the Pacific Ocean thousands of years ago, researchers say.<br><br>

                A team of scientists has discovered evidence of a substantial human settlement submerged under the Pacific Ocean on the Northwest Shelf of Australia, once part of a larger landmass known as Sahul. The findings challenge previous beliefs that the area was barren during the last ice age.<br><br>

                Stone tools found on the seafloor reveal the presence of First Nations indigenous people, with the area likely capable of supporting between 50,000 and 500,000 individuals at once. This revelation aligns with oral histories of the First Nations people, documenting rising sea levels and the forced retreat of communities as the seas encroached.

                Stars within the cluster vary in size, with some smaller and others larger than the Sun, ranging from one to five million years old. Newly formed stars in the cluster blink like Christmas lights, with X-rays capturing their volatility and strong flares, creating a festive and lively cosmic display.

                White was asked in an interview if companies would stop being political if more people like him and Elon Musk, who told advertisers boycotting X to “go fuck themselves,” called them out for their predatory behavior.<br><br>

                White: “There’s more people than just me and Elon now that feel that way. Just because you sponsor us doesn’t mean you run this business, and you’re definitely not telling me what to do. That’s a fact. That’s never going to happen, ever. Don’t ever fucking call me and tell me what you want me to do because you sponsor us. That is never going to happen. So if that’s the type of person that you are, don’t even bother trying to sponsor the UFC.”<br><br>

                There are already some signs that corporations are starting to panic. For instance, Netflix has resumed advertising on X just weeks after the streaming giant boycotted the platform over “antisemitism.”

                In November, Ramiro Rosário passed the country’s first law written by AI. The law itself was boring, related to water regulations, but it was designed to easily pass, and it did—unanimously.<br><br>

                Rosário points out that the drafting of the law would have taken a six-person team several days, compared to less than a minute for AI. All of these officials would also have to be paid, adding expenses to the government’s budget, and there would always be the possibility of human error.<br><br>

                Rosário, on replacing politicians: “There must be 20 or 30 of them—they probably won’t be needed in the future, well, to be honest, they’re already no longer needed.”<br><br>

                Tech optimists like Rosário point to data that shows wide distrust in the government. In Brazil, only 34% of voters say they trust the government, according to a study from last year.<br><br>

                Yesterday, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is ineligible to run for president under the Fourteenth Amendment, citing his calls for “insurrection” regarding the events on January 6, 2021. The Court issued a hold on the prohibition until January 4, allowing the former president to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>

                A caucus system counts votes by participants dividing themselves into groups for different candidates, usually in large rooms like school auditoriums. On the other hand, a primary system involves voters casting a traditional ballot, with names already listed (although voters can write in candidates not listed).<br><br>

                Appearing on CNN, Colorado GOP Chair Dave Williams reiterated the party’s defiance: “If need be, we're going to withdraw from the primary and go to a strict caucus process that would allow our voters to choose Donald Trump if they want.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Nearly every major news site has seen its audience decline this year, with some losing as much as 35% of traffic.<br><br>

                According to ComScore, major organizations like CNN, Fox News, The LA Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Politico all saw drops in their digital audience.<br><br>

                CNN: -20.1%<br><br>

                Fox News: -13.2%<br><br>

                The LA Times: -28.9%<br><br>

                The Wall Street Journal: -16.2%<br><br>

                Politico: -34.6%<br><br>

                This drop in readership corresponds with a drop in Americans’ trust in media, with 38% of Americans having no trust in newspapers, TV, and radio and 28% saying they do not have “very much” trust, according to a Gallup poll from October 2022.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Members of Gen Z in the UK are avoiding returning to the office at all costs.<br><br>

                Some new graduates are demanding 100% remote work, even refusing in-person interviews.<br><br>

                Employers are trying to attract younger staff with office perks like pool tables and office pets, but Gen Z finds these benefits “useless,” according to a poll by financial website Nous.co. Instead, Gen Z is valuing work-life balance, purposeful work, and personal development.<br><br>

                Debbie Porter, managing director at Destination Digital Marketing: “Over the last couple of years, I’ve had university graduates request 100% working from home and they won’t even attend the office visit for an interview. None of them have gotten very far, because I have no interest in anyone who has no interest in building a relationship with my team.”<br><br>

                Hannah Miller, who runs consultancy business Hello Sidekick: “What Gen Z wants from their managers is different. Most don't work for a pay cheque - they want purpose, they want development, rather than job satisfaction. If people are going to come to an office and sit in a booth and have no connections, why would they come into an office to do that? If the office is a place where they can build meaningful connections and exciting conversations and be a contributing force, you're going to make the effort. Just saying, 'You need to be in the office,' isn't motivating. If your relationship with your manager is difficult or toxic you're not going to travel to the office just to get a nice coffee or play on a fancy pool table.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Switzerland may start experimenting with the sale of recreational cocaine as an approach to the war on drugs.<br><br>

                The move comes after politicians have started re-examining the country’s stance after experts criticized bans as ineffective. Countries like Spain and Portugal no longer have prison sentences for the possession of drugs like cocaine, although Switzerland’s test is by far the most radical.<br><br>

                Eva Chen, a member of the Alternative Left Party: “The war on drugs has failed, and we have to look at new ideas.”<br><br>

                Frank Zobel, deputy director at Addiction Switzerland: “We have a lot of cocaine in Switzerland right now, at the cheapest prices and the highest quality we have ever seen. You can get a dose of cocaine for about 10 francs these days, not much more than the price for a beer.”

They didn't like it when I said that. And I never read ‘Mein Kampf.’ They said, oh, Hitler said that in a much different way.”<br><br>

                Trump was addressing claims that he paraphrased Hitler during a rally last weekend when he said migrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and that illegal immigrants have “poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world.”<br><br>

                The media pointed to Hitler’s 1925 manifesto, in which he writes: “All great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Gary Mund, a former crew worker in a municipal water district, says his Parkinson’s disease is because of his exposure to a common weed killer. He’s not the only one.<br><br>

                Paraquat, a highly toxic weed killer, is banned in 58 countries but is still common in the U.S. Studies indicate a strong association between paraquat and increased risk of Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement.<br><br>

                Mund is among thousands of workers suing the manufacturer Syngenta, seeking damages and ultimately hoping to see the chemical banned. Over 3,600 lawsuits have been filed against the company.<br><br>

                Saswato Das, Paraquat’s chief communications officer, wrote in an email to the LA Times: “Despite decades of investigation and myriad epidemiological and laboratory studies, no scientist or doctor — whether or not affiliated with Syngenta — has ever concluded in a peer-reviewed scientific analysis that paraquat causes Parkinson's.”<br><br>

                Experts say otherwise, such as Ray Dorsey, a professor of neurology at the University of Rochester in New York: “There have been numerous academic researchers over the last 20-plus years — and multiple different investigators in multiple different locations — that have found that paraquat, when fed to laboratory animals, reproduces the features of Parkinson's disease.”

                The Conference Board's confidence index climbed to 110.7 in December from 101 in November, with the improvement attributed to growing optimism about the labor market and inflation.<br><br>

                Expectations for lower interest rates and better buying plans also contributed to the boost.<br><br>

                Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board: “December’s increase in consumer confidence reflected more positive ratings of current business conditions and job availability, as well as less pessimistic views of business, labor market, and personal income prospects over the next six months.”

                The neighborhood’s design includes two main buildings with prefabricated timber structures, reducing waste and carbon footprint, and various mixed-use facilities for sport, leisure, and entertainment.<br><br>

                RSHP partner Stephen Barrett: “Illustrating the fact that it is possible to transform such difficult environments into places where future generations can live and work well, delivering an inclusive, exemplary mixed-use low carbon development in the process, is precisely why we consider this project so important.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In Silicon Valley, a growing group of “Immortalists,” comprised of venture capitalists, tech tycoons, crypto experts, and AI researchers, argue that any rational and good person would want to live forever—and they’ve focused their efforts on making that a possibility.<br><br>

                Different methods have been explored with significant investment, including supplements, cryogenic freezing, and digitizing consciousness. Leaders like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, and Sam Altman have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars toward companies pursuing these initiatives.<br><br>

                Within this group of “Immortalists” are different factions. There are the “Biotechs,” who are developing drugs to improve lifespan, like one that promotes autophagy—the ability of a cell to recycle molecular waste. Currently, one of the most promising treatments for this group is a drug that increases the lifespan of dogs, which has shown success in trials and is awaiting FDA approval.<br><br>

                Another group is the “Wellness Obsessives,” who think placing medical care into their own hands is the key to a longer life. Members of this school of thought include tech tycoon Bryan Johnson, who has spent millions crafting a meticulous routine designed to give him the body of an 18-year-old.<br><br>

                Lastly, there are the “Radicals,” who argue a much more revolutionary and socioeconomic approach must be pursued, like establishing futuristic cities with well-thought-out urban development. They say everything from green spaces to innovation zones can ultimately make people healthier.<br><br>

                Others, like Elon Musk, are skeptical of these efforts, saying unusual longevity would cause the “asphyxiation of society.”

These users say the free versions of the apps have become increasingly unusable, with the apps essentially becoming “pay to win” thanks to premium features like an unlimited number of likes and an increased likelihood of being seen in the swipe feed.<br><br>

                In September, Tinder rolled out a $499 monthly subscription service, and Hinge, which is owned by the same parent company as Tinder, has just unveiled a $600-a-month service.<br><br>

                Some skeptics are sounding the alarm on this trend, as many of the most popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish, are all owned by the same company, Match Group. They say this single company is effectively monopolizing romance and profiting from loneliness.

                This microwave technology, in theory, offers the ability to keep firing for as long as it retains power, allowing for the mass destruction of drones and other aerial threats. The weapons work by firing electromagnetic radiation at a drone, attacking its antennas or routes like charging ports.<br><br>

                Drones have been widely used by U.S. enemies, such as Yemen’s Houthi rebels, because of their low cost and high mobility. Some nations, like Russia, have unveiled suicide drones, which have built-in warheads to destroy infrastructure.<br><br>

                The Wall Street Journal reports that in the past few weeks, Pentagon officials have announced they want to ramp up the production of microwave weapons, recognizing that the current strategy of firing missiles costing millions of dollars isn’t tenable.

                Originally captured in Oregon, five wolves, including three males and two females, were released, with the long-term goal to reintroduce 30 to 50 within five years.<br><br>

                Colorado Governor Jared Polis: “Today, history was made in Colorado. For the first time since the 1940s, the howl of wolves will officially return to western Colorado. The shared efforts to reintroduce wolves are just getting started and wolves will rejoin a diverse ecosystem of Colorado wildlife.”<br><br>

                Wolves had vanished from the state in the 1940s following widespread hunting, trapping, and poisoning. The reintroduction aims to aid the ecosystem, as the canines keep deer and elk populations in check and redistribute nutrients through the carcasses of their prey.<br><br>

                If the new wolves kill any domestic animals, Colorado’s government will compensate ranchers up to $15,000 per animal.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A revolutionary device pulls water from the air using solar power, offering a potentially life-saving solution to dry regions.<br><br>

                The technology is based on a super hygroscopic gel and can effectively capture and retain water, even in low humidity. Remarkably, 2.2 lbs of this gel can absorb up to 2.6 lbs of water in dry conditions and 14.11 lbs in humid environments. The prototype includes a turbofan in the condensation chamber, achieving over 90% efficiency in water recovery.<br><br>

                Dr. Ruzhu Wang, researcher: “This atmospheric water harvesting technology can be used to increase the daily water supply needs, such as household drinking water, industrial water, and water for personal hygiene.”<br><br>

                This innovation could significantly aid in addressing global water scarcity, which impacts over 2.2 billion people.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Following a sweeping victory by Ye last year, the organization StopAntisemitism is asking the Internet to vote for 2023’s “Antisemite of the Year.”<br><br>

                The ten contenders for the award include:<br><br>

                Gigi Hadid, a global supermodel who has “endorsed atrocious blood libels against the Jewish nation.”<br><br>

                Roger Waters, the co-founder of Pink Floyd, for “comparing Anne Frank to a Palestinian journalist.”<br><br>

                Democrat Representative Rashida Tlaib, who had already received the award in 2019 and is up for consideration again because she “voted against acknowledging Israel as non-apartheid.”<br><br>

                Some users on X said the list is missing a few notable names, like Harvard’s President Claudine Gay, who declined to answer during congressional testimony if wishing for the genocide of Jews is protected speech.<br><br>

                Other users have responded to the shortlist differently: “If I knew it was a competition I would have tried harder,” one user wrote.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists say they have held a 20-minute conversation with a humpback whale named Twain in Southeast Alaska, a breakthrough in science.<br><br>

                The whale “spoke” to the researchers by responding to a pre-recorded call known as a “whup/throp” via underwater speakers. When the whale heard the call, he approached the research boat and responded with a greeting call. Amazingly, Twain was adjusting the frequency of his calls in response to the broadcast.<br><br>

                Brenda McCowan, scientist: “We believe this is the first such communicative exchange between humans and humpback whales in the humpback language.”<br><br>

                The ultimate goal, the scientists say, is not to merely speak with whales but with aliens, with this research helping develop “intelligence filters.”

                The Washington Post is reporting that Biden is frustrated that most polls continue to show him trailing Trump nationally and in critical swing states.<br><br>

                After pardoning a pair of turkeys as part of the annual White House tradition in November, Biden gathered his closest aides and “delivered some stern words” about his poll numbers being “unacceptably low,” The Post reports.<br><br>

                The paper continues: “He complained that his economic message had done little to move the ball, even as the economy was growing and unemployment was falling, according to people familiar with his comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.”<br><br>

                This revelation comes just two days after The Wall Street Journal reported that Barack Obama “feels that Democrats very well could lose” and “knows this is going to be a close race,” citing sources close to the former president’s thinking.

                Saudi Arabia plans to open a theater within a cliffside that will be accessed by walking up a coastal path.<br><br>

                Dubbed the “theater of the future,” Utamo is part of Saudi Arabia’s mega-project Neom, a futuristic city that is set to be 17 times larger than London. The theater features a 210-foot-high stone entrance and boasts a 2,600-seat capacity, where immersive artistic installations and performances will be held.<br><br>

                Ricardo Emilio Bofill, architect: “As we approach this big door, you realize that there's something much more special inside. You go through a space that becomes narrower and narrower and then all of a sudden, it explodes into another world that immerses you in art and performance, augmented by the most incredible technology.”<br><br>

                “Utamo is going to be one of the most unique venues in the world. A theater of the future where the greatest artists come together. It's an exclusive experience where the imagination knows no bounds,” Bofill added.<br><br>

                Neom's official statement: “Advanced audio-visual systems will captivate guests with sensory experiences, enveloping them in audio-visual wonder as they become part of the performance itself.”

                New research finds that 51% of scientists believe in God or a higher power, increasing to 66% among young scientists.<br><br>

                Among physicians, the rate is even higher, with 76% finding God and 73% “confirming their belief in ongoing miracles in modern times.”<br><br>

                Sergiu Klainerman, professor of mathematics at Princeton: “People think that science or mathematics are completely based on reason, but this is just wrong. A mathematical theorem is indeed presented as a long sequence of logical arguments but that is not the way mathematicians arrive at their truth. Every new, deep theorem starts with a leap of faith, followed by reasoned arguments and not the other way around.”<br><br>

                Klainerman points to the likes of Galileo, Newton, and Copernicus, all of whom thought God “talked” to them “through numbers and equations.”

                Countries belonging to the BRICS network are striving to challenge the USD’s dominance, sounding alarms in the U.S.<br><br>

                The network, which was originally comprised of just Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, was founded to challenge Western hegemony and has since invited six other countries, including oil-rich Iran and the UAE.<br><br>

                These nations have been gradually challenging the West through de-dollarization. In October, Egypt, a new member, issued Chinese yuan-dominated panda bonds to pay for debt. In Russia, the country’s bank now allows for Egyptian pounds to be used to set ruble exchange rates.<br><br>

                There are even efforts between China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the UAE to engineer a digital currency platform that will create a digital yuan for payments across borders.<br><br>

                Thomas Hill, former State Department official: “The BRICS-led de-dollarization effort should alarm U.S. policymakers, especially in light of the recent BRICS membership expansion. It is clear that traditional U.S. allies, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, are already exploring ways to de-dollarize, and that Beijing is helping that process move forward.”

                Carlson: “If you talk to people who have actual knowledge of it that they gathered themselves, there are parts of that story I do not understand at all that are really, really, really dark. It's so dark that I haven't told my wife about it.”<br><br>

                He added that “there’s a spiritual component” to the topic that frightens him, and that “parts of the government don't want you to know about it, but part of it is the public can't deal with it. It's too far out. The implications are too profound.”<br><br>

                While it’s unclear what exactly Carlson is referring to, we may have an idea—a report from The Daily Star in September claimed commanders in the Pentagon halted UFO research “over fears aliens were demons,” citing lead UFO researcher Ron James.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Ecologist Thomas Crowther, once an advocate of mass tree planting, is now begging people to stop planting trees.<br><br>

                In 2019, Crowther published a study that claimed the Earth could plant an additional 1.2 trillion trees as a major climate solution. At the time, scientists said this was a vast overestimation.<br><br>

                Speaking at the UN’s Climate Change Conference in Dubai this year, Crowther reversed course and said tree planting is used “as an excuse to avoid cutting emissions.”<br><br>

                “If no one had ever said, 'Plant a trillion trees,' I think we'd have been in a lot better space,” he added. “But maybe there wouldn't have been so much noise and attention on nature, so that all the very responsible scientists who are here could correct it and turn it into something that is good.”<br><br>

                Crowther said since the publication of his study, he’s learned of the overlooked consequences of mass tree planting, such as reducing biodiversity and being ineffective at capturing carbon.<br><br>

                He now sees large-scale tree planting as an easy way for corporations to “greenwash” and act like they care about the environment to mask their harmful practices.

                CEO Jonathan Greenblatt—who appeared on “The Breakfast Club” last year to assert Jews have to “get Ye”—said in a new interview: “I think my job as the head of the ADL is to call balls and strikes. Not to play for the red team, not to play for the blue team. The only team I play for is the Jewish team.”<br><br>

                It’s notable that one of the most powerful advocacy organizations in the country, perhaps even the world, is inseparable from one particular ethnic group. For instance, the organization famously gets popular users banned from social media by writing hit pieces on them, which the tech platforms catch wind of and, fearing ad boycotts, comply with the demands.<br><br>

                In September, Elon Musk blamed the ADL for lost advertising revenue, saying they are “trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic.” In response, he threatened a lawsuit and even considered banning the organization from having an account on the platform.

                Meek Mill broke into tears as he spoke at a ceremony in Pennsylvania to honor a criminal justice reform bill that reduces the chances for those on probation to return to jail for minor offenses.<br><br>

                Meek, who had been trying to get this bill passed for over five years, said in a speech: “I don't want to get emotional because it's a lot. You don't have to clap 'cause I'm at a point in my life like we all grew up in the streets, and we try to be better, but they labeled us felons and sent us back to jail. I had to fight against that the whole time to gain my respect and be who I am today, and I'm proud of that.”<br><br>

                In 2008, the artist received probation, and almost a decade later, he was sentenced to prison for violating the terms. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf granted him a pardon in January.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Investors expect LVMH and other luxury-good stocks to have a weak start in 2024, a reverse of the strong performance in 2023.<br><br>

                BNP Paribas analysts say next year will be a “game of two halves,” with a revival occurring in the second half.<br><br>

                For LVMH, 2023 was momentous, seeing the brand become the first European firm to surpass a $500 billion market value. This was largely due to surging demand in China for luxury goods after the country finally scrapped COVID restrictions.<br><br>

                China, whose consumers constitute 25% of the global luxury market, and potentially 40% by 2030, is now seeing a fading recovery and a peak in consumer spending. Thus, a revival in demand from China will be key to LVMH and other brands having a strong year.<br><br>

                Flavio Cereda, an investment manager at GAM UK: “Yes, it’s volatile at the moment. By the time we get to Easter, I would be surprised if we didn’t have signs that this is starting to reverse.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Doctors from Ivy League universities are now claiming obesity is a growing norm for Americans and should be treated with drugs.<br><br>

                In a lecture series titled “Treating Obesity: Confronting a New Normal,” doctors from Harvard and Yale say behavioral issues don’t cause obesity, and viewing the condition as such actually harms obese people.<br><br>

                Ania Jastreboff, Yale professor: “Obesity is not a personal choice. For years, the advice was that our patients needed to ‘eat less and move more.’ That does not work.”<br><br>

                David Ludwig, Harvard professor: “Western culture has considered obesity a character problem. Obesity is simply a matter of eating less and moving more, and if you can’t do it, it’s a lack of character or discipline. When in reality, obesity is more about biology than behavior. We need to think about nutrition as we think about drugs.”<br><br>

                The doctors celebrated weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, with Jastreboff saying that “we’re in an incredibly exciting time.”<br><br>

                Goldman Sachs estimates that the anti-obesity medication market could reach $100 billion by 2030, more than 16 times its $6 billion value this year.

                There is so much truth packed in this speech, so we urge you to watch it in its entirety. Here’s a preview of what Ye said.<br><br>

                “A lot of people had shit to say about my Jewish comments, but then none of you in this motherfucking room, and none of you entertainment niggas, ever said nothing when I was praying to see my kids.”<br><br>

                “Don’t tell me about my fucking political opinions, I made more money to show you that money ain’t nothing. It’s our money nigga. It’s our country nigga. It’s how they stole it from us—it’s pyramids.”<br><br>

                “They can’t fucking touch me. Why? Cause God cover me. He covered me. And guess what? Trump: we ain’t giving you support unless you get Larry out. Unless you get Jeff out. Because politicians think they’re just going to get our shit for free. All of a sudden because you got a mugshot—you think you with us now? What are you going to do for us?”<br><br>

                “The French own 80% of the banks in Africa. That’s why I just met with MBS, head of Saudi. We don’t have to bow to this. There are 60 million of us in America and 16 million Jews in the world. 50% of our deaths are abortions. 25% of us go to prison. Raise your hand if you don’t know one nigga in prison, one nigga locked up, and one nigga poor. Raise your hand if you don’t know one person who got an abortion. If we were in a Jewish room on a Friday, everyone would raise their hand. But who makes the hospitals? These are Zionists.”<br><br>

                “Koolau Ranch” will be set on Kauai island, featuring over a dozen buildings with two mansions connected by an underground tunnel leading to a 5,000-square-foot shelter.<br><br>

                It has been partially constructed and is expected to be one of the most expensive personal construction projects today.<br><br>

                Zuckerburg spent $170 million on the land to build his ranch, which will house at least thirty bedrooms and bathrooms, along with eleven “disk-shaped” tree houses connected by rope bridges.<br><br>

                Entrances and exits will have keypad locks and soundproofing, while the library will feature a super-secret “blind” door.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Young TikTokers are making videos saying it’s “impossible” to find a well-paying corporate job in 2023.<br><br>

                One fitness influencer with 600,000 followers said she has “a bone to pick with America,” explaining: “So, I'm headed to my serving job … I fucking hate it. I have my literal business marketing degree that put me in a cute $80,000 in debt and I make more serving sushi rolls.”<br><br>

                “I'm an almost 25-year-old chick going against corporate ass America … people with so much experience. All I got is my degree. People say get your degree, but then they don't talk about how you need experience. The degree was the experience.”<br><br>

                A different TikToker echoed these sentiments in a video with almost a million views, saying: “I know my worth in the workplace and I can't get a job. Now, I can get a job for $18 an hour, but $18 an hour in this economy doesn't cut it. I need to be making at least $70,000 a year and that's not even to be living lavish. That's to be fucking surviving.”<br><br>

                She added that she had just been laid off from a well-paying job and had applied to over 500 jobs since, only receiving one interview, which didn’t go anywhere, and rejection letters from the rest.<br><br>

                One user said that unless you have connections at a company or are extraordinarily qualified, “there's a 9 out of 10 chance that you are not getting the job.”<br><br>

                There are likely lots of reasons for this trend, including an unstable economy—job openings fell to their lowest level in two years this October—and the rise of AI that both replaces jobs and filters through applications automatically, only seeking a select type of candidate.<br><br>

                This all comes as a new Business Insider survey found that 28% of Gen Z preferred socialism over capitalism.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A former Harvard Medical School professor named Merle Berger has been accused by a former patient of inseminating her with his own sperm, without her knowledge, during an IVF procedure.<br><br>

                Sarah Depoian claims in a new lawsuit that Berger told her the sperm was from a “medical resident who resembled her husband, who did not know her, and whom she did not know.”<br><br>

                This occurred in 1980, but the horrific secret did not surface until Depoian’s daughter, Carolyn Bester, took at-home DNA tests that linked her to Berger’s relatives.<br><br>

                Bester: “To say I was shocked when I figured this out would be an extreme understatement. It feels like reality has shifted.”<br><br>

                “My mom put her trust in Dr. Berger as a medical professional during one of the most vulnerable times in her life. He had all the power and she had none.”<br><br>

                Berger’s legal representation has denied the allegations and suggested they’re fabricated.<br><br>

                Ian Pinta, lawyer: “The allegations concern events from over 40 years ago, in the early days of artificial insemination. The allegations, which have changed repeatedly in the six months since the plaintiff’s attorney first contacted Dr. Berger, have no legal or factual merit, and will be disproven in court.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Despite only making up 15% of the settler population in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Jewish Americans have been at the forefront of expanding settlements on land expropriated from Palestinians, leading to the rise of “settler violence.”<br><br>

                The Guardian reports that many of the 60,000 Americans living there have little to do with settlement, but there is “a core of ideologically driven U.S. citizens” who have disproportionately contributed to the 500 Palestinians killed in the West Bank this year, including dozens of children.<br><br>

                Hadar Susskind, president of Americans for Peace, says these settlers draw inspiration from two Americans known as the godfathers of violence against Palestinians.<br><br>

                The first is Baruch Goldstein, a doctor from Brooklyn, who murdered 29 Muslim worshippers in the West Bank in 1994.<br><br>

                Goldstein was a follower of the second inspiration, American Rabbi Meir Kahane, who founded the extremist Kach party that was banned in both Israel and the U.S. under anti-terrorism laws.<br><br>

                Susskind: “Those people are the prophets of the settler movement.”<br><br>

                “Earlier this year I led a trip to Israel and Palestine. We went to Hebron and stopped in Meir Kahane park where they have a shrine to Baruch Goldstein. His grave is there. It’s shocking that they have a public park named after an American whose party was declared so racist that it was not allowed to be in the Knesset, a person who espoused violence and hatred. And then a shrine to Baruch Goldstein who took those lessons from Kahane and actualized them in murdering a group of people at prayer.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                As renewable energy grows in popularity, the same problems keep emerging: wind can stop blowing, the sun can stop shining, or there could be too much energy for a grid to handle.<br><br>

                As a result, companies have started turning to batteries. And the key to successful battery systems lies under Earth.<br><br>

                A growing number of companies have started using common rocks that connect directly to solar and wind, or electricity sourced through the grid. These systems turn captured energy into heat stored in the rocks. <br><br>

                When users need power, the heat is converted into steam or electricity. Examples of this system include Brenmiller Energy, which uses crushed volcanic rock, while Antora Energy uses graphite, and Rondo uses bricks.<br><br>

                Doron Brenmiller, chief business officer at Brenmiller Energy: “When selecting the material, a few things come into consideration. First, heat capacity. Then you have to think about other parameters like cost, the availability of the material, and what happens to the material over time. We use volcanic rocks because they have particularly good heat capacity, and they can be sourced quite easily.”<br><br>

                Ry Storey-Fisher, Antora’s policy manager: “In our case, we use blocks of solid carbon. This is an earth-abundant material that’s produced in millions of tons a year… These blocks stay stable to extremely high temperatures, and we basically heat those up to thousands of degrees Celsius in an insulated container, like a shipping container-sized module.”

                Over half of all U.S. ETF flows are controlled by just three firms: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan. This raises the risks of mispricing, especially during market stress.<br><br>

                Athanasios Psarofagis, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst: “If something does happen again, are other APs going to step in?

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In 2016, city officials in West Palm Beach, Florida, wished to figure out why the city’s waterfront had so few visitors.<br><br>

                After hiring a team of researchers and consultants, they found the cause: people “didn’t kind of feel welcome.”<br><br>
                
                In response, officials launched a complete renovation of the area, adding colorful and green art boxes, adding movable chairs and tables to create opportunities for social interaction, and installing translucent picture frames with photographs that gave people a reason to linger.<br><br>
                
                This innovative approach to urban planning as a means to bring people together is now happening all across the world. In Salem, Massachusetts, officials created “Happy to Chat” benches in public spaces to ease isolation among residents. Sweden and Germany have launched similar programs. In the Netherlands, a supermarket chain has added “slow” checkout lanes to encourage chatter among shoppers.<br><br>
                
                These initiatives address a serious problem—in the U.S., young adults, many of whom are packed in urban areas, see the highest rates of loneliness at 79%.<br><br>
                
                In May, the U.S. Surgeon General released a report on loneliness that emphasized the strengthening of America’s “social infrastructure,” including libraries, parks, commercial districts, sporting venues, and public transportation.<br><br>
                
                Setha Low, a cultural anthropologist at the City University of New York: “Americans in general are experiencing a lot of fear. The more we don’t interact with each other, the more afraid and anxious we become.”

                Witnesses say bodies of Palestinian children are seen piled up inside a school, west of a refugee camp.<br><br>

                Witness: “The Israeli soldiers came in and opened fire on them. They took an old man. The Israeli soldiers stormed the school, took all the men, then entered classrooms and opened fire on a woman and all the children with her. Even the newborn babies among them. She, her husband, and her eight children, together with her cousin — the Israeli soldiers executed those innocent families.”<br><br>

                These harrowing scenes come after reports of Israeli military members posting videos online of them breaking into homes in Gaza and pridefully boasting about it.

                Instead, small storefronts like restaurants and coffee shops are increasing, driven by dining out, food-delivery and drive-thrus.<br><br>

                Retailers signed leases averaging 3,200 square feet during the first 3 quarters of 2023, the smallest size since data firm CoStar Group began tracking in 2006.<br><br>

                Brandon Svec, CoStar’s national director of U.S. retail analytics: “A shopping center today looks very different than it did 10 years ago. The focus is much more on experience, much more on food and beverage.”<br><br>

                Food and beverage companies signed nearly 20% of all retail leases this year, with most targeting spaces 5,000-square-feet or smaller.<br><br>

                Nationwide, the rate of available retail space was 4.8% in the third quarter of 2023, the lowest level in the 18 years the data has been tracked by real-estate-services firm CBRE.

                According to the company, searches for “sex robots” surged 1,689% globally, which experts say isn’t a surprise.<br><br>

                Dr. Laurie Betito: ”Search trends over the years always coincide with what’s trending in technology. Right now, we are seeing a lot about the development of ‘sex robots,’ so who wouldn’t be curious about that?”<br><br>

                Sentencing is scheduled for March 19, 2024.<br><br>

                The DOJ: “From January 2017 to September 2021, Furlow-Smiles led Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs at Facebook and was responsible for developing and executing DEI initiatives, operations, and engagement programs.”<br><br>

                U.S. Attorney Ryan K.

                The Center for Medical Progress first reported in 2019 on the experiments, which included scalping fetuses just five months old to stitch their scalps and back skin onto rats. Additionally, the fetal kidneys were transported to other researchers.<br><br>

                CMP’s president David Daleiden confirmed to The Daily Wire that the university is now under federal investigation: “The University of Pittsburgh has been a center for some of the most barbaric experiments, government-funded experiments, on the body parts of late-term aborted babies. We now have the first confirmation with these FOIA documents that this is all subject of a formal federal law enforcement investigation of the Office of Inspector General.”<br><br>

                In response to the allegations, Pitt hired an “outside law firm,” which claimed the university complied with the law.

                A painting that was valued at just $15,000 two years ago has since been identified as a Rembrandt painting, selling now for a staggering $13.8 million.<br><br>

                The painting, “Adoration of the Kings,” had been unseen for 75 years until it was acquired by a collector in Amsterdam in 1955. It was originally attributed to the “Circle of Rembrandt.”<br><br>

                After the auction house Sotheby’s performed extensive research, including X-rays and infrared imaging, the painting was confirmed to be an “autograph work by Rembrandt.”<br><br>
                
                Painted circa 1628, the piece, which depicts the biblical scene, represents a rare narrative painting by Rembrandt, contrasting with his more common portraits.

                The justices will review a case brought by Joseph Fischer, who has been charged with obstructing an official congressional proceeding on that day.<br><br>

                Fischer says the crime he’s charged with is meant for people tampering with evidence, enacted as part of the Enron corruption scandal, and not for people who participated in a riot.<br><br>

                A U.S. District Court agreed with Fischer and two other defendants charged with the same crime, saying they had to have taken some action involving evidence.<br><br>

                Over 300 other defendants have been charged with this crime, and if the appeal goes through, their charges could also be reversed.<br><br>

                Trump is also charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, so the appeal’s ramifications could extend as far as him.

                Thus, many on social media are seeing this as secretly being motivated by the outcry over Israel’s alleged war crimes in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian activists have celebrated the move as a victory for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Bloomberg followed several students of the class of 2024, soon to graduate, who say they can’t find jobs in sectors like tech and finance.<br><br>

                One student, Mikael Rahmani, a Boston University senior, is facing difficulties in finding a job in finance despite having good grades, internships, and extracurricular activities.<br><br>

                Rahmani applies to about fifteen jobs per week but has yet to secure a job.<br><br>

                Other seniors interviewed by Bloomberg reported similar results, saying their internship prospects in previous years don’t align with their bad luck in the job market.<br><br>

                This trend comes as white-collar companies navigate an uncertain economy and higher-than-usual interest rates, spurring layoffs and reduced hiring.<br><br>

                Career services at even the best universities say full-time recruitment is strangely quiet, and most interns are not receiving job offers.<br><br>

                Kory Kantenga, an analyst at LinkedIn, noted that many of these graduates are finding it difficult to match a job with their skillset: “Are you going to end up as a barista with a bachelor’s degree?”<br><br>

                This all comes as nearly half of all U.S. companies plan to eliminate Bachelor’s degree requirements, according to a November survey of 800 employers, including major corporations like Walmart and IBM.<br><br>

                In other words: if you’re in college, you better graduate with a useful degree, or you’ll be competing with people who didn’t waste 50 racks a year to go to mid frat parties.

                The recall of more than two million follows a two-year government investigation into crashes involving Autopilot, some of which were fatal.<br><br>

                New software updates will increase driver alerts and limit Autopilot's use in certain areas to make sure the driver is paying attention.<br><br>

                The recall affects Tesla models Y, S, 3, and X made between 2012 and 2023.<br><br>

                Tesla shares dropped over 3% after the recall announcement.<br><br>

                Philip Koopman, professor at Carnegie Mellon University: “The compromise is disappointing because it does not fix the problem that the older cars do not have adequate hardware for driver monitoring.”<br><br>

The buttocks shouldn’t be too wide, and should retain the characteristic dimple on the sides.”<br><br>

                The study also reported that there is a rising interest among men to get procedures like butt lifts.<br><br>

                These preferences differ from studies on the ideal female cheeks, which favored a rounder, fuller appearance.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A zoologist in New Zealand spotted a bird with both male and female characteristics while on vacation in Colombia.<br><br>

                The bird, a Green Honeycreeper, was half green, typical of females, and half blue, characteristic of males.<br><br>

                This phenomenon of a male and female hybrid has been seen in butterflies, crustaceans, spiders, lizards, and rodents, but is extremely rare for birds.<br><br>

                Professor Hamish Spencer: “The phenomenon arises from an error during female cell division to produce an egg, followed by double-fertilization by two sperm.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Harvard University President Claudine Gay will retain her position despite backlash over her comments regarding antisemitism.<br><br>

                The saga began when Gay, alongside presidents from MIT and UPenn, testified to Congress last week about a purported rise of “antisemitic” incidents on college campuses.<br><br>

                When Gay was asked if wishing for the genocide of Jews is restricted speech, she refused to answer “yes” or “no,” saying that it depends on the context.<br><br>

                This drew the ire of prominent Jewish donors, with reports that Harvard lost over $1 billion in donations since the testimony.<br><br>

                Gay has since apologized for her remarks, saying she “failed to convey what is my truth.”<br><br>

                Today, Harvard’s governing body released a statement saying they support Gay and will not vote for her resignation.<br><br>

                The Harvard Corporation: “As members of the Harvard Corporation, we today reaffirm our support for President Gay’s continued leadership of Harvard University. … President Gay has apologized for how she handled her congressional testimony and has committed to redoubling the university’s fight against antisemitism.”

            <h3 class="hecho">Reverse American Dream: Leave U.S.</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Due to high costs and challenging living conditions in the U.S., an increasing number of Americans are moving abroad.<br><br>

                The number of American expatriates is up to 9 million from 6.8 million in 2013.<br><br>

                Americans like JP Stonestreet and Amelia Basista, who moved to Ecuador, express no regrets about moving and say they even lost 50 pounds.<br><br>

                Stonestreet: “I was really close to either dying or being paralyzed from neck down and we realized working towards a retirement we may never be able to afford wasn’t worth it. That was when we realized the American dream was dying - that it doesn’t exist any more. Many people are telling us they'll have to work until they die, they’re stuck in this cycle.”<br><br>

                An October poll found that only 36% of Americans still believe in the “American dream” that “if you work hard you’ll get ahead,” with many citing crippling debt, soaring house prices, and a “toxic hamster wheel” culture.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Republican lawmakers in Missouri have proposed a law that would allow women who receive abortions to be charged with murder.<br><br>
                
                The legislation would offer exceptions if a woman undergoes an abortion after being threatened, or if the abortion was a life-saving measure.<br><br>

                Representative Bob Titus: “To me, it’s just about protecting a baby’s life like we do every other person’s life. The prosecution is just a consequence of taking an innocent human life.”<br><br>

                Abortion is already illegal in Missouri at all stages of pregnancy, so the sponsors of this bill say women just need to follow the law.<br><br>

                Similar laws have been proposed in other states, including South Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky, but they never advanced.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Trump has taken the liberty to point out that Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who is running for president as a Republican, is not exactly “fit for office.”<br><br>

                The former president posted a picture of Christie to Truth Social that shows his wide, thick hips in full force, adding as a caption: “Not fit for office, mentally or physically. We need strong people not suffering from a harsh terminal disease, TDS, TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME!!!”<br><br>

                To be sure, Trump isn’t the first to point this out. In an interview from 2012, Barbara Walters asked Christie: “Why are you overweight?”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The Australian furniture brand Derlot has released a new collection that aims to encourage a smooth flow of travel in airports.<br><br>

                Derlot crafted this collection to transform often uncomfortable airport hubs into spaces that feel welcoming and relaxing.<br><br>

                It features lounge seating called Twig, a long bench seat that organically branches out like a growing tree.<br><br>

                Another seating design is the geometric Prisma collection, which features different-shaped modules that can be combined into a range of seating configurations.<br><br>

                The collection also includes lighting, such as modular Coral Lighting, which has a geometric form reminiscent of oceanic lifeforms.<br><br>

                Derlot: “The furniture layouts encourage a sense of tranquility amidst the bustling atmosphere of an airport. Our innovative approach emphasizes organic layouts and connectivity at the heart of our designs, crafting flexible and relaxed settings that enhance the overall airport experience. Derlot is set to revolutionize the way we perceive airports.”
