            <p class="paragraphr">
                Seoul is boosting security with AI-backed cameras in parks and trails to deter crime and enhance safety.<br><br>

                The new cameras will identify suspicious activities like wandering, falling, or assault, immediately alerting control rooms. They’ve been installed in 25 districts and operate 24/7. By 2026, the city hopes to install over 10,000 AI cameras.<br><br>

                The initiative was accelerated after a man raped and murdered a female teacher, confessing to police that he chose the location because of its lack of surveillance.<br><br>

                Kim Jin-man, head of the Digital Policy Bureau: “Cameras help to protect the lives and safety of citizens. We will eliminate blind spots to protect citizens from crimes through this measure.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                An analyst says Microsoft’s launch of its AI chatbot CoPilot is a pivotal “iPhone moment” for the company.

                Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says the integration of the AI tool across Microsoft’s ecosystem, including Windows, Dynamics 365, and Office will accelerate productivity and contribute to a “golden $1 trillion AI spending wave” over the next decade. He compared this surge to the internet boom of the 1990s.<br><br>

                Dan Ives: “In a nutshell based on our recent work in the field we believe over the next three years over 60% of its Microsoft installed base will ultimately be on this AI functionality for the enterprise/commercial,” adding that CoPilot could add $25 billion to Microsoft's total revenue next year. <br><br>

                The tool is set to be rolled out over the next three to six months, meaning 2025 should mark an inflection point for Microsoft. The growing potential led Ives to raise his Microsoft price target to $450 from $425—a potential upside of 21% from current levels.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Russia and Iran have agreed to use their local currencies in trade, abandoning the U.S. dollar.<br><br>

                The move comes as the members of the BRICS alliance—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—have pushed for global de-dollarization to threaten the West’s hegemony. For instance, Russia has declared it will no longer accept the USD as payment for its energy commodities but will instead switch to Chinese and Emirati currencies.<br><br>

                Still, the effort to abandon the USD up to now has been slow, and the dollar's stability and dominance in cross-border transactions make it a tough competitor.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A group of women in Mexico who dress as nuns and call themselves the “Sisters of the Valley” are striving to reclaim marijuana from the narcos, hoping to use the drug’s healing power to spread the Gospel.<br><br>

                The sisters frequently post on Instagram, where they show themselves caring for cannabis crops. In the U.S., they've turned their cause into a successful business, earning over $500,000 last year by selling CBD products.<br><br>

                They draw inspiration from a religious movement in the Middle Ages called the Beguines, which was made up of single women and devoted itself to spirituality without taking formal vows.<br><br>

                With the narcos dominating the drug trade in Mexico, the women see themselves at odds with them. “We want to take the plant back from the narcos,” Sister Bernardet said.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse has been fired over his porn activities with his wife, which included videos of them cooking vegan meals with well-known porn stars.<br><br>

                Joe Gow and his wife promoted their OnlyFans, which includes “fully explicit scenes,” on X under the handle @SexyHappyCouple. The pair had also written two books under pseudonyms about porn.<br><br>

                Gow has refused to apologize, emphasizing that his activities are protected by the First Amendment and that no university resources were used to create the videos.<br><br>

                In 2018, Gow had a pay raise denied after inviting porn star Nina Hartley to speak on campus for $5,000.<br><br>

                The president of Wisconsin’s university system condemned Gow’s actions, and another top official said she was “alarmed and disgusted.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Water is increasingly at the center of global conflicts, from Ukraine to the Middle East.<br><br>

                During 2022 and the first half of 2023, 344 instances of water-related conflicts occurred worldwide, according to data compiled by researchers at the Pacific Institute. Their data shows a major uptick in violence incidents driven by the targeting of dams in water systems.<br><br>

                Peter Gleick, the Pacific Institute’s co-founder and senior fellow: “It's very disturbing that in particular attacks on civilian water infrastructure seem to be on the rise. We also see a worrying increase in violence associated with water scarcity worsened by drought, climate disruptions, growing populations, and competition for water.”<br><br>

                Since 2000, there have been over 1,630 water-related conflicts, with a rising trend over the last decade.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A senior Russian diplomat warned Finland that it would be the “first to suffer” if tensions escalated between Moscow and NATO.<br><br>

                Finland, which borders Russia and maintained a neutral status for decades, joined NATO in April. The move was prompted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and doubled the length of the border that NATO shares with Russia.<br><br>

                At the time, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Putin was opposed to NATO expanding to the east, citing it as a justification for his actions in Ukraine. Stoltenberg said that Putin “is getting exactly the opposite... Finland today, and soon also Sweden will become a full-fledged member of the alliance.”<br><br>

                Russian diplomat Mikhail Ulyanov on Thursday: “They had lived calmly and in peace and suddenly ended up between Russia and NATO as a member of that alliance, but since they are our neighbors, if, God forbid there is some escalation, they will be the first to suffer.”

                In 2023, giants like Disney, Warner, Comcast, and Paramount faced over $5 billion in streaming losses. They're now eyeing drastic measures, including cuts, mergers, and selling off parts of their empire.<br><br>

                Paramount is looking at a sale with Skydance, while Warner and Comcast might merge, amid falling TV ad revenue, increased cord-cutting, and the soaring costs of sports and movies.<br><br>

                Netflix comes out on top, adding 9 million subscribers and boasting profits, while others struggle to find a “viable business model” amid price hikes and subscriber losses.<br><br>

                Rich Greenfield, Analyst at LightShed Partners: “TV advertising is falling far short, cord-cutting is continuing to accelerate, sports costs are going up and the movie business is not performing. Everything is going wrong that can go wrong. The only thing the companies know how to do to survive is try to merge and cut costs.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Michigan’s Supreme Court has upheld a lower court ruling allowing Trump to remain on the 2024 primary ballot, diverting from Colorado’s decision to ban the former president from the state ballot.<br><br>

                Activists in Michigan alleged Trump incited insurrection on January 6, 2021, and thus was ineligible to run for president under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the argument, noting that no provision in Michigan law requires a presidential candidate “to attest to their legal qualification to hold the office.”<br><br>

                Last week, Colorado ruled that the argument was valid. The Colorado Supreme Court said Trump would not be banned until January 4, pending an overruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>

                Lawsuits opposing Trump's ballot eligibility have been filed in state courts in Oregon, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, as well as federal district courts in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, New York, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A new report finds that 37% of business leaders say technology replaced workers in 2023, with 44% reporting that there will be layoffs in 2024 due to AI efficiency.<br><br>

                The report, conducted by ResumeBuilder, evaluated 750 business leaders.<br><br>

                Julia Toothacre, resume and career strategist at ResumeBuilder, emphasized the findings may not be as scary as they seem: “There are still so many traditional organizations and small businesses that do not embrace technology the way that some of the larger companies do.”<br><br>

                In a separate report by Asana, employees said 29% of their work tasks are replaceable by AI. Still, Asana emphasizes “human-centered AI,” arguing that human abilities can be enhanced by AI, not replaced.<br><br>

                In August, Goldman Sachs issued a report that estimated AI investment will approach $200 billion by 2025.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A poll from the Daily Mail finds that one in five young Americans have a positive view of Osama Bin Laden, with 30% seeing his ideologies as a “force for good.”<br><br>

                The poll surveyed 1,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29.<br><br>

                Terry Strada, national chair of 9/11 Families United, blames the school system: “What is wrong with our youth? How do they not realize the horrors of terrorism? This is a dangerous and slippery slope to go down.”<br><br>

                Brett Eagleson, 9/11 family member: “The minds of this country’s youth are being perverted by our government's feckless inability to be honest with itself and hold the rightful parties accountable, so we actually have a situation where a significant number of young people are praising the murder and death of our neighbors.”<br><br>

                Notably, this poll comes after bin Laden’s manifesto “Letter to America” went viral on TikTok last month, with young users finding his arguments against America and Israel persuasive.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A Chinese carmaker is on track to overtake Tesla in global electric vehicle (EV) sales, becoming the new worldwide leader in the market.<br><br>

                The diverse and affordable range of China’s BYD challenges Tesla’s pricier models, analysts say. Government subsidies in China have further fueled the surge.<br><br>

                Bridget McCarthy, head of China operations, Snow Bull Capital: “The competitive landscape of the auto industry has changed. It's no longer about the size and legacy of auto companies; it's about the speed at which they can innovate and iterate. BYD began preparing long ago to be able to do this faster than anyone thought possible, and now the rest of the industry has to race to catch up.”<br><br>

                In November, the European Union’s commission chief warned that Beijing’s government subsidies need to be investigated, saying they may result in “clear overcapacity.” China now rivals Japan for the global leader in passenger car exports, with over one million of the 3.6 million vehicles shipped from the country this year being electric.

                Swatting occurs when someone or multiple individuals call local law enforcement pretending to be someone else, saying they are about to commit a crime, typically involving murder or suicide. The perpetrators tend to use fake phone numbers or other layers of privacy to prevent police from tracking them down.<br><br>

                Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, and Representative Brandon Williams were all targeted on Christmas.<br><br>

                In June, the FBI launched a national database to track these incidents, following a push from Senator Chuck Schumer,  who called the attacks “dangerous, disturbing and downright terrifying.”<br><br>

                Representative Greene: “I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here.”

                The New York Times has sued ChatGPT developer OpenAI and shareholder Microsoft for copyright infringement.<br><br>

                The media company alleges that the AI’s “unlawful use of The Times's work to create artificial intelligence products that compete with it threatens The Times's ability to provide that service.”<br><br>

                To come to this conclusion, The Times ran an analysis of the data used to train AI and found that its content was likely used more than other sets of content.<br><br>

                Notably, the company says in its lawsuit that it “seeks to hold them responsible for the billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages.”<br><br>

                This is the first major media company to sue AI companies for copyright infringement and could set a precedent for how courts evaluate AI training.

                Israel's military chief is warning of an extended conflict in Gaza, stating it may last “many more months” to dismantle Hamas fully.<br><br>

                Despite international calls for a ceasefire, Israel insists that an immediate truce would benefit Hamas. Nearly 21,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began on October 7, according to local health officials.<br><br>

                Herzi Halevi, Israel Defense Forces chief of staff: “There are no magic solutions. There are no shortcuts when it comes to thoroughly dismantling a terrorist organization, except being stubborn and determined in the fighting. We eliminated many terrorists and commanders. Some of them surrendered to our forces, and we took hundreds of prisoners. We destroyed many underground infrastructures and weapons. This war has necessary and not easy goals to achieve. It takes place in complex territory. That’s why the war will continue for many more months, and we will work with different methods, so that the achievement will be maintained for a long time.”<br><br>

                Craigievar Castle’s unique hue comes from a “top secret” recipe of limewash and earth pigments, applied in multiple coats to protect the historic building and its collections.<br><br>

                The pink color, originally an off-white, was a 19th-century addition to match the granite moldings.<br><br>

                Disney is believed to have based his designs of fairy tale castles on the Scottish location after seeing pictures of it.<br><br>

                Gille Young, regional conservator: “It’s really important we look after this castle. If we look after the building, then the collections inside are looked after as well. It’s going to be really positive, particularly for the local community who look up from the main road and see this beautiful pink castle which glows at the best of times.”

                Nearly 60 French actors have denounced the “lynching” of French film icon Gerard Depardieu, who is facing sexual assault claims, saying he faces a “torrent of hatred.”<br><br>

                These actors wrote in an open letter published in a French newspaper: “Gérard Depardieu is probably the greatest of all actors. The last sacred monster of cinema. We can no longer remain silent in the face of the lynching he is facing.”<br><br>

                Depardieu, who has appeared in over 200 films and TV shows, was charged with rape in 2000 and has since been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women.<br><br>

                The letter adds that Depardieu is being attacked “in defiance of a presumption of innocence from which he would have benefited, like everyone else, if he weren't the cinema giant he is. When people attack Gérard Depardieu in this way, they are attacking art.”<br><br>

                Notably, the signatories include Depardieu’s former partner, actress Carole Bouquet.<br><br>

                Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron said Depardieu had become the target of a “manhunt,” emphasizing the importance of the presumption of innocence.

                Ken Dorph wrote in an op-ed for CNN: “The talk seemed intended to offer instruction on how to deflect tough questions challenging the government of Benjamin Netanyahu and its violence against the Palestinians, rather than inform. I confronted the speaker to counter what I considered inaccuracies in the presentation and when it was over, I shared how disappointing I found it. The talk was unhelpful and sounded to my ears like a propaganda session.”<br><br>

Not only was I sad for losing the chance to ride in the Village on the firetruck in all my jolly glory, but I felt thwacked in my bowlful of jelly for speaking out in another life, as another character.”<br><br>

                The Russian president wishes to enter negotiations on the basis that Crimea and the Donbass would be fully recognized as Russian territory.

                The report comes after the White House warned last week that aid to Ukraine will run out unless Congress approves a new spending bill. The U.S. has approved over $110 billion for the eastern European country since the conflict began in February 2022.

                The emergence of AI girlfriends is creating a shift in actual human relationships, with experts warning about the long-term effects on society.<br><br>

                These virtual companions are customizable down to the finest detail and offer an idealized partnership. As AI technology advances, the virtual beings are becoming increasingly lifelike, mastering human interactions and emotions, and offering a level of perfection that real relationships can't compete with.<br><br>

                Liberty Vittert, professor of data science: “They look like real people and are shockingly good when it comes to replicating human interactions. Physical AI robots that can satisfy humans emotionally and sexually will become a stark reality in less than ten years. It’s always this perfect relationship for lonely single men, which is very dangerous because it further isolates them from real human connections.”<br><br>

                Analysts note that the emergence of AI girlfriends comes as birthrates are at a historical low and loneliness is already at an all-time high. Additionally, men are already interacting with women less and less—a poll from earlier this year found that 59% of men aged 18 to 25 have not approached a woman in the past year.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                An editorial in The Washington Post pointed out something that caught our attention: “Sometime in recent history, possibly around 2004, Americans forgot to have fun, true fun, as though they’d misplaced it like a sock.”<br><br>

                The article explores various evidence for this: there are now podcasts on how to be happy, vacations are often overscheduled with so many activities that relaxation becomes exhaustion, and we’ve become obsessed with social media, turning us into dopamine-seeking guinea pigs.<br><br>

                “I feel like I should be having more fun than I’m actually having,” says Alyssa Alvarez, a 27-year-old social media marketing manager and DJ. “I’m addicted to my phone. You live in this social realm, using it as a social crutch instead of making true connections.”<br><br>

                Alvarez has hired a “party coach” who meets with her biweekly, assigning her podcasts, instructing her to journal, and teaching her how to discover new outlets to have fun.<br><br>

                Evan Cudworth, 37, party coach: “So many people are retreating into their phones, into anxiety. I’m helping people rediscover what fun means to them.”<br><br>

                The editorial blames several factors for this lack of fun plaguing Americans. A culture that prioritizes efficiency, productivity, and prestige over leisure; technological advances that capture our attention and expose our insecurities; and an increased sense of dreariness in the workplace, driven by heightened individualism and decreased trust for each other.<br><br>

                Todd Davis, 66, corporate fun coach: “We go to work and there’s no sense of connection and camaraderie. People feel emotionally disconnected. Healthy conversations are the precursor of fun. We’ve lost the art of communication. Our spirit comes home with us. If you don’t communicate at work, what are you coming home with?”

                In a new report, Human Rights Watch accuses Facebook and Instagram parent Meta of “systemic and global” censorship of pro-Palestinian content since the war's onset on October 7.<br><br>

                The report cites over 1,000 instances, including post removals, account bans, interaction restrictions, and “shadow banning” that reduces visibility and reach.<br><br>

                Meta has denied the allegations, calling the systemic censorship claim “misleading.” It cited its human rights due diligence and the complexity of content moderation in a polarized conflict. Still, the company’s oversight board admitted errors, reinstating two significant videos depicting scenes from the war.<br><br>

                The claims come as TikTok, seen as a competitor to Meta, is facing opposite allegations: that it favors pro-Palestinian content. Earlier this month, reports emerged that Jewish tech executives met with TikTok’s CEO to discuss the bias concerns. Some, such as Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, have gone so far as to say that spending time on TikTok increases someone’s likelihood of being “antisemitic” to a significant extent.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Starting January 1, early versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, along with other 1928 works, will enter the public domain, allowing free use and reinterpretation by artists and creators.<br><br>

                The reason for this is copyright law: U.S. law allows copyright to be held for 95 years, after which it enters the public domain. Modern versions of the iconic character will remain unaffected.<br><br>

                Jennifer Jenkins, director of the Duke Center for the Study of the Public Domain: “This is a big one. It’s generating so much excitement in the copyright community — it’s finally happening.”<br><br>

                Lawrence Lessig, Harvard law professor: “Let’s hope it’s the opening of a new chapter. The biggest weakness in copyright is that we have no way to know who owns what. It’s the most inefficient property system known to man.”

                Terry, a dog who was just 12 weeks old when he was rescued from abuse, is celebrating his first proper Christmas with the vet nurse who saved him.<br><br>

                The puppy was brought to a vet two years ago, when a doctor discovered the white of his left eye and his lips were both bruised. Three of his upper incisors were also missing and another tooth was broken.<br><br>

                Nurse Rachel Coombes fell in love with him, promising her colleagues that she would adopt him if he survived. He did—and she brought him into her home.<br><br>

                Although Terry celebrated Christmas with Rachel and her son Stanley, four, last year, this will be their “first proper” celebration, as he’s now finally settled in with them.<br><br>

                Coombes: “I just felt a connection as soon as he was brought in, as he was in such a state. He hasn’t looked back since—and is having the best of life right now. He enjoys running around the garden and going to the beach. Last year we got him around Christmas but it was such a hectic time for him and he was learning to settle then. Now we are planning a proper Christmas celebration for him.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                California Governor Gavin Newsom called the efforts to remove Trump from the California ballot “a political distraction,” saying that “in California, we defeat candidates at the polls.”<br><br>

                His comments come after his lieutenant governor sent a letter to California’s secretary of state on Wednesday requesting options be explored to ban Trump from the state’s presidential ballot. The effort was launched following the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision on Tuesday that Trump is ineligible to run for president because he incited “insurrection” on January 6, 2021, and thus is prohibited from appearing on Colorado’s ballot.<br><br>

                Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis wrote to California’s secretary of state that “California must stand on the right side of history,” adding: “The constitution is clear: you must be 35 years old and not be an insurrectionist.”<br><br>

                Newsom’s remarks embody what many see as his ongoing attempt to appear level-headed to the rest of the country. He’s appeared on Fox News on several occasions this year, suggesting an effort to appeal to conservative voters, perhaps in anticipation of a presidential run in the future.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Church leaders in Bethlehem, the Palestinian city where Jesus Christ was born, have decided to cancel Christmas celebrations this year due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.<br><br>

                Typically, the historical city is packed with more than three million visitors to celebrate the birth of Christ, replete with celebrations of singers and dangers and fireworks, illuminated by a beautiful tree in the center of the town square. This year, the streets are dark and hushed.<br><br>

                Pastor Munther Isaac told Christianity Today that “nobody was going to celebrate. Nobody is in a mood to celebrate,” because the locals are so horrified by what they say is a genocide committed by Israel in Gaza.<br><br>

                However, Christian leaders in Bethlehem will still praise Christ on Christmas. They say the cancelation of spectacular celebrations will help them focus on the true meaning of Christmas.<br><br>

                Elias Al-Najjar, a youth ministry leader, told a group of children and teenagers: “All these small details that we don’t usually think about. On Christmas, we usually put up decorations and have fun with Christmas trees and lights. But if you look at the real story of Christmas, it was a story of pure hardship. But God didn’t leave Mary and Joseph. And they didn’t leave God. So why should we?”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists at MIT have engineered a new pill that leaves dieters feeling full, potentially serving as a treatment for obesity.<br><br>

                The pill, called Vibes, works by vibrating in the stomach for 30 minutes before a meal, triggering stretch receptors that simulate the presence of food. This stimulation sends signals to the brain's hypothalamus via the vagus nerve, altering hormone levels to create a feeling of fullness and decrease hunger.<br><br>

                In tests with pigs, the pill led to a nearly 40% decrease in food consumption.<br><br>

                The researchers envision the pill as a non-invasive, temporary therapy for weight management. Unlike drug-based weight loss methods, the Vibes pill avoids significant side effects and offers a new avenue for non-surgical weight management.<br><br>

                Hefty student debt and the availability of well-paying jobs not requiring degrees are prompting many to reconsider the traditional college path. Many members of Gen Z are finding financial success without a degree, highlighting a real-time shift in career dynamics.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Tucker Carlson released a video on X in which he described Julian Assange, the founder of media watchdog WikiLeaks who is wanted by the U.S. government, as one of the “greatest journalists of our age,” blasting his treatment as a villain by the West.<br><br>

                Carlson noted that in the 2016 presidential election, Assange “upended” the race by publishing internal emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). These emails revealed that Hillary Clinton had rigged the primaries against her opponent, Bernie Sanders. For instance, in one May 2016 email, DNC National Secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote: “Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.”<br><br>

                Democrats claimed the Russian government hacked the emails and then supplied them to Assange, which Carlson said is “a lie.” “The emails had been leaked from within the DNC itself, almost certainly by a disgruntled employee,” Carlson emphasized.<br><br>

                Carlson is likely referring to Seth Rich, an employee of the DNC who was shot twice in the back in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood in July 2016. Assange has hinted in interviews that Rich was the source of the emails.<br><br>

                Rich’s murder was peculiar for several reasons. Police described it as a robbery despite no valuables having been taken, the perpetrators were never apprehended, and the FBI ordered to disclose the information on his work laptop and personal laptop following his death. Activists have demanded transparency for years, to no avail.

                The report utilized AI tools to analyze satellite imagery, identifying 1,600 potential bomb craters, with evidence of at least 200 significant bombings in the supposedly safe zones. The use of large bombs in densely populated areas has sparked debates about the proportionality and ethics of Israel's military tactics, with activists pointing out the high risk to civilian life.<br><br>

                Allies are showing concerns, with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin urging Israel to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian aid, and UK's Foreign Secretary David Cameron advocating for a more “surgical” approach.<br><br>

                Marc Garlasco, former UN war crimes investigator: “When you're talking about a densely populated area like Gaza, there's going to be certain concerns about collateral effects, particularly widespread collateral effects.”<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In September, Elon Musk's Neuralink started recruiting volunteers for clinical trials of its brain-computer interface (BCI), aiming to merge humans with AI to aid paralyzed individuals.<br><br>

                Neuralink is just one company in the emerging field of brain implants. Competitors like Synchron have shown long-term safety in their implants, while new startups like Forest Neurotech have similarly found success.<br><br>

                In January, Synchron published data showing that its device can safely transmit neural signals from inside a blood vessel in the brain for a year without any serious side effects, assisting paralyzed patients. Forest Neurotech wishes to address psychiatric and cognitive disorders by using sound waves to read the brain and deliver therapeutic stimulation.<br><br>

                The origins of BCIs date back to the 1960s and 1970s, when lab animals were tested. As the understanding of the human brain grew, so too did the sophistication of the devices, allowing paralyzed patients to play video games, move robotic arms, and communicate with their minds.<br><br>

                Robert Gaunt, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who studies BCIs: “We are at a stage where there’s been enough demonstrations of feasibility that companies have stepped in to try to make real products and medical devices. Whether or not any of them will be successful is a different story entirely.”

                Stone tools found on the seafloor reveal the presence of First Nations indigenous people, with the area likely capable of supporting between 50,000 and 500,000 individuals at once. This revelation aligns with oral histories of the First Nations people, documenting rising sea levels and the forced retreat of communities as the seas encroached.

                Japan is set to offer free university tuition to families with three or more children starting in 2025.<br><br>

                This initiative is part of a plan to combat the country's declining birth rate and will have no household income ceiling, aiming to reduce educational expenses and encourage families to have more children. It’s also not limited to universities, extending to junior and technical colleges, among other educational institutions.<br><br>

                Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has prioritized addressing the declining birth rate amid an aging population, with the number of newborns in 2022 being the lowest since records began in 1899.<br><br>

                Around the world, the fertility rate has fallen from an average of five births per woman in 1950 to 2.3 births per woman in 2021, according to the UN.

                French President Emmanuel Macron is refusing to disown an actor accused of sexual crimes, emphasizing the importance of the presumption of innocence.<br><br>

                Film icon Gerard Depardieu, who has appeared in over 200 films and TV shows, has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women, following a rape charge in 2000.<br><br>

                Macron was asked during an interview if Depardieu should be stripped of France’s highest state award, which he received nearly three decades ago.<br><br>

                Macron: “You will never see me take part in a manhunt. I hate that kind of thing. The presumption of innocence is part of our values.”<br><br>

                The president added that he has “huge admiration” for Depardieu, whom he considers “an immense actor.”<br><br>

                Feminist activists and some politicians have described Macron's comments as supportive of rape culture, an insult to sexual violence victims, and out of touch with societal values. They point out that Macron stripped Harvey Weinstein of the same award in 2017.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                After 48 years in prison, Glynn Simmons has been declared innocent of a 1974 murder, making him the longest-imprisoned American to be exonerated.<br><br>

                An Oklahoma judge cited "clear and convincing evidence" that Simmons didn't commit the crime, following a discovery that key evidence hadn’t been shared with Simmons' defense, leading to a call for a new trial in July. This evidence included a police report that showed an eyewitness might have identified other suspects.<br><br>

                District Attorney Vicki Behenna said in September that there is no longer physical evidence in the case against Simmons and announced she would not retry him. She fell short of declaring him innocent.<br><br>

                The court's decision now entitles Simmons to up to $175,000 in wrongful conviction compensation and the possibility of a federal lawsuit.<br><br>

                Simmons has always maintained his innocence, saying he was in Louisiana at the time of the murder, not Oklahoma.<br><br>

                Simmons: “It’s a lesson in resilience and tenacity. Don’t let nobody tell you that it can’t happen, because it really can.”

                Over half a million people in Gaza are starving because of “woefully insufficient” quantities of food, the UN reports.<br><br>

                Ever since Israel began its intrusion in Gaza, essential supplies like food, electricity, and gas have been limited, resulting in a situation worse than what unfolded in Yemen and Afghanistan last decade.<br><br>

                Arif Husain, chief economist for the UN’s World Food Program: “It doesn’t get any worse. I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza. And at this speed. How quickly it has happened, in just a matter of two months.”<br><br>

                Israeli officials have said the war will continue for months to ensure all Hamas militants are rooted out. Nearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, with 1.9 million (more than 80% of the population) driven from their homes. Only nine of Gaza’s 36 health facilities are still partially functioning.

                Assad: “There is no evidence that six million Jews were killed. Perhaps there were holocausts, nobody denies this. True, there were concentration camps. But what this shows you is that this is a politicized issue and is not a humanitarian issue and is not real. How come we talk about these six millions but not about the 26 million Soviets killed in that war? Are those six million more precious?”<br><br>

                “However, this issue was politicized in order to falsify the truth and later to prepare for the transfer of Jews from Europe to other areas. Or rather, to Palestine.”<br><br>

                Other Middle Eastern leaders have also questioned the event, including Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, who said last year that “there are some signs” the Holocaust happened as described but “if so, they should allow it to be investigated and researched.”

                To do this, the researchers exposed participants to 1,200 images and then analyzed the connection between their brain signals and the visual stimuli using brain scanning. This mapping was then used to train AI to decipher and replicate the imagery derived from the brain activity.<br><br>

                The team successfully created vivid depictions, including a detailed leopard and an airplane with red-wing lights. The images were also visible to others, a feat once seen as a challenge.<br><br>

                Colorado’s Republican Party announced its presidential primary will switch to a caucus next year if Trump’s disqualification from the ballot remains.<br><br>

                Yesterday, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is ineligible to run for president under the Fourteenth Amendment, citing his calls for “insurrection” regarding the events on January 6, 2021. The Court issued a hold on the prohibition until January 4, allowing the former president to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>

                Following the decision, the state’s GOP wrote on X: “We will withdraw from the Primary as a Party and convert to a pure caucus system if this is allowed to stand.”<br><br>

                A caucus system counts votes by participants dividing themselves into groups for different candidates, usually in large rooms like school auditoriums. On the other hand, a primary system involves voters casting a traditional ballot, with names already listed (although voters can write in candidates not listed).<br><br>

                Appearing on CNN, Colorado GOP Chair Dave Williams reiterated the party’s defiance: “If need be, we're going to withdraw from the primary and go to a strict caucus process that would allow our voters to choose Donald Trump if they want.”

                Some new graduates are demanding 100% remote work, even refusing in-person interviews.<br><br>

                Employers are trying to attract younger staff with office perks like pool tables and office pets, but Gen Z finds these benefits “useless,” according to a poll by financial website Nous.co. Instead, Gen Z is valuing work-life balance, purposeful work, and personal development.<br><br>

                Debbie Porter, managing director at Destination Digital Marketing: “Over the last couple of years, I’ve had university graduates request 100% working from home and they won’t even attend the office visit for an interview. None of them have gotten very far, because I have no interest in anyone who has no interest in building a relationship with my team.”<br><br>

                Hannah Miller, who runs consultancy business Hello Sidekick: “What Gen Z wants from their managers is different. Most don't work for a pay cheque - they want purpose, they want development, rather than job satisfaction. If people are going to come to an office and sit in a booth and have no connections, why would they come into an office to do that? If the office is a place where they can build meaningful connections and exciting conversations and be a contributing force, you're going to make the effort. Just saying, 'You need to be in the office,' isn't motivating. If your relationship with your manager is difficult or toxic you're not going to travel to the office just to get a nice coffee or play on a fancy pool table.”

                Gary Mund, a former crew worker in a municipal water district, says his Parkinson’s disease is because of his exposure to a common weed killer. He’s not the only one.<br><br>

                Paraquat, a highly toxic weed killer, is banned in 58 countries but is still common in the U.S. Studies indicate a strong association between paraquat and increased risk of Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement.<br><br>

                Mund is among thousands of workers suing the manufacturer Syngenta, seeking damages and ultimately hoping to see the chemical banned. Over 3,600 lawsuits have been filed against the company.<br><br>

                Saswato Das, Paraquat’s chief communications officer, wrote in an email to the LA Times: “Despite decades of investigation and myriad epidemiological and laboratory studies, no scientist or doctor — whether or not affiliated with Syngenta — has ever concluded in a peer-reviewed scientific analysis that paraquat causes Parkinson's.”<br><br>

                Experts say otherwise, such as Ray Dorsey, a professor of neurology at the University of Rochester in New York: “There have been numerous academic researchers over the last 20-plus years — and multiple different investigators in multiple different locations — that have found that paraquat, when fed to laboratory animals, reproduces the features of Parkinson's disease.”

Members of this school of thought include tech tycoon Bryan Johnson, who has spent millions crafting a meticulous routine designed to give him the body of an 18-year-old.<br><br>

                Lastly, there are the “Radicals,” who argue a much more revolutionary and socioeconomic approach must be pursued, like establishing futuristic cities with well-thought-out urban development. They say everything from green spaces to innovation zones can ultimately make people healthier.<br><br>

                Others, like Elon Musk, are skeptical of these efforts, saying unusual longevity would cause the “asphyxiation of society.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A judge has ordered the release of court documents naming 177 associates of Jeffrey Epstein, set for early January 2024, the Daily Mail reports.<br><br>

                The documents are part of a defamation case brought by Prince Andrew’s accuser Virginia Roberts against Epstein's madam Ghislaine Maxwell. Roberts sued Maxwell in 2015, accusing her of defamation when she called Roberts a liar over claims that she and Epstein sexually abused her. Roberts further alleges Prince Andrew participated in sexual misconduct alongside Epstein and Maxwell.<br><br>

                Names to be released include Epstein's friends, recruiters, victims, and employees, like housekeepers from his private island. Material likely includes depositions, emails, and legal documents, with some linking to high-profile figures like Prince Andrew.

                The era of free dating apps seems to be fading, with users increasingly paying for premium services.<br><br>

                A report from the Pew Research Center found that 35% of Americans who have used one of these services have paid to do so at some point. These users say the free versions of the apps have become increasingly unusable, with the apps essentially becoming “pay to win” thanks to premium features like an unlimited number of likes and an increased likelihood of being seen in the swipe feed.<br><br>

                In September, Tinder rolled out a $499 monthly subscription service, and Hinge, which is owned by the same parent company as Tinder, has just unveiled a $600-a-month service.<br><br>

                Blaine Anderson, a men’s dating coach: “The days of venture capital-subsidized swiping are over. Companies want to monetize the services they provide to eager singles.”<br><br>

                Some skeptics are sounding the alarm on this trend, as many of the most popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish, are all owned by the same company, Match Group. They say this single company is effectively monopolizing romance and profiting from loneliness.

Ghana faces a severe economic crisis and a $3 billion loan request from the International Monetary Fund.<br><br>

                The Pentagon is increasingly considering high-power microwave weapons to disrupt or fry drones, an increasing threat.<br><br>

                This microwave technology, in theory, offers the ability to keep firing for as long as it retains power, allowing for the mass destruction of drones and other aerial threats. The weapons work by firing electromagnetic radiation at a drone, attacking its antennas or routes like charging ports.<br><br>

                Drones have been widely used by U.S. enemies, such as Yemen’s Houthi rebels, because of their low cost and high mobility. Some nations, like Russia, have unveiled suicide drones, which have built-in warheads to destroy infrastructure.<br><br>

                The Wall Street Journal reports that in the past few weeks, Pentagon officials have announced they want to ramp up the production of microwave weapons, recognizing that the current strategy of firing missiles costing millions of dollars isn’t tenable.

                Officials have introduced wolves in western Colorado, three years after voters approved their reintroduction.<br><br>

                Originally captured in Oregon, five wolves, including three males and two females, were released, with the long-term goal to reintroduce 30 to 50 within five years.<br><br>

                Colorado Governor Jared Polis: “Today, history was made in Colorado. For the first time since the 1940s, the howl of wolves will officially return to western Colorado. The shared efforts to reintroduce wolves are just getting started and wolves will rejoin a diverse ecosystem of Colorado wildlife.”<br><br>

                Wolves had vanished from the state in the 1940s following widespread hunting, trapping, and poisoning. The reintroduction aims to aid the ecosystem, as the canines keep deer and elk populations in check and redistribute nutrients through the carcasses of their prey.<br><br>

                If the new wolves kill any domestic animals, Colorado’s government will compensate ranchers up to $15,000 per animal.

                The probe comes after the EU last year passed the Digital Services Act, which aims to fight “disinformation” on social media and penalizes companies with fines of up to 6% of annual revenue and an eventual ban from the EU if no action is taken.<br><br>

                The investigation aims to uncover if X stops “illegal content” and whether the Community Notes feature is sufficient enough to fight “information manipulation.”<br><br>

                As noted in the European Digital Media Observatory’s 2023 briefing, key “disinformation trends” include opposing migration, questioning vaccines, and the “wider anti-woke narrative that mocks social justice campaigns and efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.”<br><br>

It is clear that traditional U.S. allies, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, are already exploring ways to de-dollarize, and that Beijing is helping that process move forward.”

                Following the announcement earlier this month that the highly-anticipated GTA VI will not be released until 2025, fans have been scrambling to figure out how long they must endure.<br><br>

                A new leak, allegedly from a janitor at Rockstar’s London office, suggests a September 2025 release.<br><br>

                Fans saw this and immediately became pessimistic, with one writing: “Yeah, they announce September 2025, so they can push it back to December 2025.”<br><br>

                Another user was overrun with emotions, lamenting that the rumor is “too painful to deal with right now.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Netflix is resuming ads on Elon Musk’s platform just one month after the streaming giant halted $3 million worth of ads over “antisemitism.”<br><br>

                Users have since spotted ads for Netflix’s new films “Maestro” and “May December.”<br><br>

                This may be the beginning of a victory for Musk—if more advertisers return to the platform just one month after leaving, that’s a sign X is far too lucrative to abandon, and that the promises of a free speech platform may come to fruition.

                A 30-year-old man from the UK suffered a rare accident, tearing his windpipe after holding in a sneeze.<br><br>

                He pinched his nose and closed his mouth while driving, resulting in the first known incident.<br><br>

                CT and MRI scans revealed a hole in his windpipe, typically caused by physical trauma.<br><br>

                He fully recovered in five weeks with painkillers and allergy meds.<br><br>

                Doctors: “We suspect the trachea perforated due to a rapid build-up of pressure in the trachea while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth. Everyone should be advised not to stifle sneezes by pinching the nose while keeping the mouth closed as it can result in tracheal perforation.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Appearing on the podcast “Redacted,” Tucker Carlson said the topic of aliens is one of the few he’s genuinely scared to talk about, with him learning things that are too dark he can’t even tell his wife.<br><br>

                Carlson: “If you talk to people who have actual knowledge of it that they gathered themselves, there are parts of that story I do not understand at all that are really, really, really dark. It's so dark that I haven't told my wife about it.”<br><br>

                He added that “there’s a spiritual component” to the topic that frightens him, and that “parts of the government don't want you to know about it, but part of it is the public can't deal with it. It's too far out. The implications are too profound.”<br><br>

                While it’s unclear what exactly Carlson is referring to, we may have an idea—a report from The Daily Star in September claimed commanders in the Pentagon halted UFO research “over fears aliens were demons,” citing lead UFO researcher Ron James. James said there’s “a very large contingent of people” in the U.S. government who align with Christian fundamentalism and actively oppose any research into extraterrestrial life.

                Magician and stunt performer Anastasia Synn is now the Guinness world record holder for the most technological implants, leading her to be dubbed “world’s ultimate cyborg.”<br><br>

                Her 52 implants range from practical uses like opening locks to more personal ones like a locket containing her late husband's ashes.<br><br>

                She's part of a global community of “biohackers,” implanting technology into their bodies.<br><br>

                Her journey into biohacking began with a magnetic chip in her finger, inspired by her daughter's interest.<br><br>

                Synn: “She came up to me when she was probably about 16 and said, ‘I want to get this microchip, there's this gamer girl online and she can unlock her computer with her microchip so nobody else can get into it.’ So I said, ‘Listen, I don't know if it's safe or not so how about I get it and we'll see how it works out,’ because I thought it was pretty cool when she told me about it.'”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Researchers have engineered a new imaging technology, inspired by butterflies, that can differentiate between normal and cancerous cells with 99% accuracy.<br><br>

                Cancerous cells show a unique glow when exposed to UV light, a key factor in their identification through this tech.<br><br>

                Professor Viktor Gruev, lead researcher: “We’ve taken inspiration from the visual system of butterflies, who are able to perceive multiple regions in the UV spectrum, and designed a camera that replicates that functionality.”<br><br>

                Professor Shuming Nie: “Imaging in the UV region has been limited and I would say that has been the biggest roadblock for making scientific progress. Now we have come up with this technology where we can image UV light with high sensitivity and can also distinguish small wavelength differences. This new imaging technology is enabling us to differentiate cancerous versus healthy cells and is opening up new and exciting applications beyond just health.”<br><br>

                Researchers hope to use this technology in surgical procedures.

                The U.S. military will enter 2024 with its smallest active-duty force since World War II, totaling just over 1.2 million personnel and facing one of its “greatest challenges,” officials say.<br><br>

                The Army, Navy, and Air Force missed 2023 recruitment targets, with only the Marine Corps and Space Force meeting their goals.<br><br>

                Two decades ago, 25% of young people did not consider joining the military, with that number now being over 50%. The Army is down 8.4% in the past three years alone.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Ecologist Thomas Crowther, once an advocate of mass tree planting, is now begging people to stop planting trees.<br><br>

                In 2019, Crowther published a study that claimed the Earth could plant an additional 1.2 trillion trees as a major climate solution. At the time, scientists said this was a vast overestimation.<br><br>

                Speaking at the UN’s Climate Change Conference in Dubai this year, Crowther reversed course and said tree planting is used “as an excuse to avoid cutting emissions.”<br><br>

                “If no one had ever said, 'Plant a trillion trees,' I think we'd have been in a lot better space,” he added. “But maybe there wouldn't have been so much noise and attention on nature, so that all the very responsible scientists who are here could correct it and turn it into something that is good.”<br><br>

                Crowther said since the publication of his study, he’s learned of the overlooked consequences of mass tree planting, such as reducing biodiversity and being ineffective at capturing carbon.<br><br>

                He now sees large-scale tree planting as an easy way for corporations to “greenwash” and act like they care about the environment to mask their harmful practices.

                The Anti-Defamation League, the advocacy organization leading the ad boycott against X that has cost the platform $1.5 billion this year, admits they don’t care about Republicans or Democrats and only serve one group: Jews.<br><br>

                CEO Jonathan Greenblatt—who appeared on “The Breakfast Club” last year to assert Jews have to “get Ye”—said in a new interview: “I think my job as the head of the ADL is to call balls and strikes. Not to play for the red team, not to play for the blue team. The only team I play for is the Jewish team.”<br><br>

                It’s notable that one of the most powerful advocacy organizations in the country, perhaps even the world, is inseparable from one particular ethnic group. For instance, the organization famously gets popular users banned from social media by writing hit pieces on them, which the tech platforms catch wind of and, fearing ad boycotts, comply with the demands.<br><br>

                In September, Elon Musk blamed the ADL for lost advertising revenue, saying they are “trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic.” In response, he threatened a lawsuit and even considered banning the organization from having an account on the platform.

                Investors expect LVMH and other luxury-good stocks to have a weak start in 2024, a reverse of the strong performance in 2023.<br><br>

                BNP Paribas analysts say next year will be a “game of two halves,” with a revival occurring in the second half.<br><br>

                For LVMH, 2023 was momentous, seeing the brand become the first European firm to surpass a $500 billion market value. This was largely due to surging demand in China for luxury goods after the country finally scrapped COVID restrictions.<br><br>

                China, whose consumers constitute 25% of the global luxury market, and potentially 40% by 2030, is now seeing a fading recovery and a peak in consumer spending. Thus, a revival in demand from China will be key to LVMH and other brands having a strong year.<br><br>

                Doctors from Ivy League universities are now claiming obesity is a growing norm for Americans and should be treated with drugs.<br><br>

                In a lecture series titled “Treating Obesity: Confronting a New Normal,” doctors from Harvard and Yale say behavioral issues don’t cause obesity, and viewing the condition as such actually harms obese people.<br><br>

                Ania Jastreboff, Yale professor: “Obesity is not a personal choice. For years, the advice was that our patients needed to ‘eat less and move more.’ That does not work.”<br><br>

                David Ludwig, Harvard professor: “Western culture has considered obesity a character problem. Obesity is simply a matter of eating less and moving more, and if you can’t do it, it’s a lack of character or discipline. When in reality, obesity is more about biology than behavior. We need to think about nutrition as we think about drugs.”<br><br>

                The doctors celebrated weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, with Jastreboff saying that “we’re in an incredibly exciting time.”<br><br>

                Goldman Sachs estimates that the anti-obesity medication market could reach $100 billion by 2030, more than 16 times its $6 billion value this year.

                “The French own 80% of the banks in Africa. That’s why I just met with MBS, head of Saudi. We don’t have to bow to this. There are 60 million of us in America and 16 million Jews in the world. 50% of our deaths are abortions. 25% of us go to prison. Raise your hand if you don’t know one nigga in prison, one nigga locked up, and one nigga poor. Raise your hand if you don’t know one person who got an abortion. If we were in a Jewish room on a Friday, everyone would raise their hand. But who makes the hospitals? These are Zionists.”<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Young TikTokers are making videos saying it’s “impossible” to find a well-paying corporate job in 2023.<br><br>

                One fitness influencer with 600,000 followers said she has “a bone to pick with America,” explaining: “So, I'm headed to my serving job … I fucking hate it. I have my literal business marketing degree that put me in a cute $80,000 in debt and I make more serving sushi rolls.”<br><br>

                “I'm an almost 25-year-old chick going against corporate ass America … people with so much experience. All I got is my degree. People say get your degree, but then they don't talk about how you need experience. The degree was the experience.”<br><br>

                A different TikToker echoed these sentiments in a video with almost a million views, saying: “I know my worth in the workplace and I can't get a job. Now, I can get a job for $18 an hour, but $18 an hour in this economy doesn't cut it. I need to be making at least $70,000 a year and that's not even to be living lavish. That's to be fucking surviving.”<br><br>

                She added that she had just been laid off from a well-paying job and had applied to over 500 jobs since, only receiving one interview, which didn’t go anywhere, and rejection letters from the rest.<br><br>

                One user said that unless you have connections at a company or are extraordinarily qualified, “there's a 9 out of 10 chance that you are not getting the job.”<br><br>

                There are likely lots of reasons for this trend, including an unstable economy—job openings fell to their lowest level in two years this October—and the rise of AI that both replaces jobs and filters through applications automatically, only seeking a select type of candidate.<br><br>

                This all comes as a new Business Insider survey found that 28% of Gen Z preferred socialism over capitalism.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A former Harvard Medical School professor named Merle Berger has been accused by a former patient of inseminating her with his own sperm, without her knowledge, during an IVF procedure.<br><br>

                Sarah Depoian claims in a new lawsuit that Berger told her the sperm was from a “medical resident who resembled her husband, who did not know her, and whom she did not know.”<br><br>

                This occurred in 1980, but the horrific secret did not surface until Depoian’s daughter, Carolyn Bester, took at-home DNA tests that linked her to Berger’s relatives.<br><br>

                Bester: “To say I was shocked when I figured this out would be an extreme understatement. It feels like reality has shifted.”<br><br>

                “My mom put her trust in Dr. Berger as a medical professional during one of the most vulnerable times in her life. He had all the power and she had none.”<br><br>

                Berger’s legal representation has denied the allegations and suggested they’re fabricated.<br><br>

                Ian Pinta, lawyer: “The allegations concern events from over 40 years ago, in the early days of artificial insemination. The allegations, which have changed repeatedly in the six months since the plaintiff’s attorney first contacted Dr. Berger, have no legal or factual merit, and will be disproven in court.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Despite only making up 15% of the settler population in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Jewish Americans have been at the forefront of expanding settlements on land expropriated from Palestinians, leading to the rise of “settler violence.”<br><br>

                The Guardian reports that many of the 60,000 Americans living there have little to do with settlement, but there is “a core of ideologically driven U.S. citizens” who have disproportionately contributed to the 500 Palestinians killed in the West Bank this year, including dozens of children.<br><br>

                Hadar Susskind, president of Americans for Peace, says these settlers draw inspiration from two Americans known as the godfathers of violence against Palestinians.<br><br>

                The first is Baruch Goldstein, a doctor from Brooklyn, who murdered 29 Muslim worshippers in the West Bank in 1994.<br><br>

                Goldstein was a follower of the second inspiration, American Rabbi Meir Kahane, who founded the extremist Kach party that was banned in both Israel and the U.S. under anti-terrorism laws.<br><br>

                Susskind: “Those people are the prophets of the settler movement.”<br><br>

                “Earlier this year I led a trip to Israel and Palestine. We went to Hebron and stopped in Meir Kahane park where they have a shrine to Baruch Goldstein. His grave is there. It’s shocking that they have a public park named after an American whose party was declared so racist that it was not allowed to be in the Knesset, a person who espoused violence and hatred. And then a shrine to Baruch Goldstein who took those lessons from Kahane and actualized them in murdering a group of people at prayer.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                As renewable energy grows in popularity, the same problems keep emerging: wind can stop blowing, the sun can stop shining, or there could be too much energy for a grid to handle.<br><br>

                As a result, companies have started turning to batteries. And the key to successful battery systems lies under Earth.<br><br>

                A growing number of companies have started using common rocks that connect directly to solar and wind, or electricity sourced through the grid. These systems turn captured energy into heat stored in the rocks. <br><br>

                When users need power, the heat is converted into steam or electricity. Examples of this system include Brenmiller Energy, which uses crushed volcanic rock, while Antora Energy uses graphite, and Rondo uses bricks.<br><br>

                Doron Brenmiller, chief business officer at Brenmiller Energy: “When selecting the material, a few things come into consideration. First, heat capacity. Then you have to think about other parameters like cost, the availability of the material, and what happens to the material over time. We use volcanic rocks because they have particularly good heat capacity, and they can be sourced quite easily.”<br><br>

                Ry Storey-Fisher, Antora’s policy manager: “In our case, we use blocks of solid carbon. This is an earth-abundant material that’s produced in millions of tons a year… These blocks stay stable to extremely high temperatures, and we basically heat those up to thousands of degrees Celsius in an insulated container, like a shipping container-sized module.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                U.S. ETF assets have more than doubled in five years, with over 1,000 new funds and a $11 trillion jump in annual trading volumes.<br><br>

                Despite this growth, the number of Authorized Participants (APs), crucial for ETF liquidity, remains almost unchanged.<br><br>

                Over half of all U.S. ETF flows are controlled by just three firms: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan. This raises the risks of mispricing, especially during market stress.<br><br>

                Taisiya Sikorskaya, a PhD candidate at London Business School: “Our message is that investors and retail traders have to be aware of this. This mispricing that we find exists exactly in times when investors would like to rebalance, would like to fly to safety.”<br><br>

                Athanasios Psarofagis, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst: “If something does happen again, are other APs going to step in? You know, we like to think that they will, and hopefully that they will. But I don’t know if we have enough data to say, ‘Oh yeah, this will definitely happen.’”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In 2016, city officials in West Palm Beach, Florida, wished to figure out why the city’s waterfront had so few visitors.<br><br>

                After hiring a team of researchers and consultants, they found the cause: people “didn’t kind of feel welcome.”<br><br>
                
                In response, officials launched a complete renovation of the area, adding colorful and green art boxes, adding movable chairs and tables to create opportunities for social interaction, and installing translucent picture frames with photographs that gave people a reason to linger.<br><br>
                
                This innovative approach to urban planning as a means to bring people together is now happening all across the world. In Salem, Massachusetts, officials created “Happy to Chat” benches in public spaces to ease isolation among residents. Sweden and Germany have launched similar programs. In the Netherlands, a supermarket chain has added “slow” checkout lanes to encourage chatter among shoppers.<br><br>
                
                These initiatives address a serious problem—in the U.S., young adults, many of whom are packed in urban areas, see the highest rates of loneliness at 79%.<br><br>
                
                In May, the U.S. Surgeon General released a report on loneliness that emphasized the strengthening of America’s “social infrastructure,” including libraries, parks, commercial districts, sporting venues, and public transportation.<br><br>
                
                Setha Low, a cultural anthropologist at the City University of New York: “Americans in general are experiencing a lot of fear. The more we don’t interact with each other, the more afraid and anxious we become.”

                Al Jazeera reports that the Israeli army stormed a school in northern Gaza, where they ripped children and women and proceeded to murder them execution-style, according to witnesses.<br><br>

                Witnesses say bodies of Palestinian children are seen piled up inside a school, west of a refugee camp.<br><br>

                Witness: “The Israeli soldiers came in and opened fire on them. They took an old man. The Israeli soldiers stormed the school, took all the men, then entered classrooms and opened fire on a woman and all the children with her. Even the newborn babies among them. She, her husband, and her eight children, together with her cousin — the Israeli soldiers executed those innocent families.”<br><br>

                These harrowing scenes come after reports of Israeli military members posting videos online of them breaking into homes in Gaza and pridefully boasting about it. They also come as The Washington Post reports that Israel is deploying white phosphorous supplied by the U.S., which humanitarian groups say could constitute a violation of international humanitarian law.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The average store size in the U.S. is now the smallest in at least 17 years, reflecting a shift in American shopping habits.<br><br>

                The rise of e-commerce has reduced the need for large department stores and big-box spaces.<br><br>

                Instead, small storefronts like restaurants and coffee shops are increasing, driven by dining out, food-delivery and drive-thrus.<br><br>

                Retailers signed leases averaging 3,200 square feet during the first 3 quarters of 2023, the smallest size since data firm CoStar Group began tracking in 2006.<br><br>

                Brandon Svec, CoStar’s national director of U.S. retail analytics: “A shopping center today looks very different than it did 10 years ago. The focus is much more on experience, much more on food and beverage.”<br><br>

                Food and beverage companies signed nearly 20% of all retail leases this year, with most targeting spaces 5,000-square-feet or smaller.<br><br>

                Nationwide, the rate of available retail space was 4.8% in the third quarter of 2023, the lowest level in the 18 years the data has been tracked by real-estate-services firm CBRE.

                Bloomberg followed several students of the class of 2024, soon to graduate, who say they can’t find jobs in sectors like tech and finance.<br><br>

                One student, Mikael Rahmani, a Boston University senior, is facing difficulties in finding a job in finance despite having good grades, internships, and extracurricular activities.<br><br>

                Rahmani applies to about fifteen jobs per week but has yet to secure a job.<br><br>

                Other seniors interviewed by Bloomberg reported similar results, saying their internship prospects in previous years don’t align with their bad luck in the job market.<br><br>

                This trend comes as white-collar companies navigate an uncertain economy and higher-than-usual interest rates, spurring layoffs and reduced hiring.<br><br>

                Career services at even the best universities say full-time recruitment is strangely quiet, and most interns are not receiving job offers.<br><br>

                Kory Kantenga, an analyst at LinkedIn, noted that many of these graduates are finding it difficult to match a job with their skillset: “Are you going to end up as a barista with a bachelor’s degree?”<br><br>

                This all comes as nearly half of all U.S. companies plan to eliminate Bachelor’s degree requirements, according to a November survey of 800 employers, including major corporations like Walmart and IBM.<br><br>

                In other words: if you’re in college, you better graduate with a useful degree, or you’ll be competing with people who didn’t waste 50 racks a year to go to mid frat parties.

            <h3 class="hecho">Tesla Recalls Almost All U.S. Cars</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Tesla is recalling nearly all of its vehicles sold in the U.S. to address a software issue and a defective system in their Autopilot feature.<br><br>

                The recall of more than two million follows a two-year government investigation into crashes involving Autopilot, some of which were fatal.<br><br>

                New software updates will increase driver alerts and limit Autopilot's use in certain areas to make sure the driver is paying attention.<br><br>

                The recall affects Tesla models Y, S, 3, and X made between 2012 and 2023.<br><br>

                Tesla shares dropped over 3% after the recall announcement.<br><br>

                Philip Koopman, professor at Carnegie Mellon University: “The compromise is disappointing because it does not fix the problem that the older cars do not have adequate hardware for driver monitoring.”<br><br>

                Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety: "It’s not answering the question of why are Teslas on Autopilot not detecting and responding to emergency activity?"

                Brands like Bottega Veneta, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton are embracing mundane, everyday moments in their latest campaigns, a departure from the elegance and glamor that typically characterize the campaigns.<br><br>
                
                In Bottega Veneta’s Pre-Spring 2024 campaign called “Readymade,” A$AP Rocky and Kendall Jenner are pictured carrying groceries, pumping gas, drinking coffee, and jogging.<br><br>

                As noted by The Business of Fashion, the pictures weren’t produced by a fashion photographer but by paparazzi, who first published the pictures in TMZ.<br><br>

                In September, Gucci also released paparazzi-style images featuring Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner in the airport with Gucci luggage.<br><br>

                And in Pharrell’s first Louis Vuitton campaign, Rihanna carried a coffee cup while wearing a Speedy bag, almost like she was running an errand.<br><br>

                Riccardo Zanola, the art director behind several of Gucci’s latest campaigns: “People want to be related to. We’ve been dreaming too much about other places, other spaces, other worlds.”

                During the Roman Empire, communal bathing was common, acting as a space for socializing and relaxation.<br><br>

                The Washington Post reports that Israel’s army used white phosphorous shells, manufactured by the U.S., in an attack on south Lebanon in October.<br><br>

                If true, this may mean Israel has violated the international humanitarian law prohibition on putting civilians at unnecessary risk.<br><br>

                Amnesty International confirmed the use of white phosphorus in Al-Dhahira on October 16, describing the attack as a potential war crime.<br><br>

                Israel has used white phosphorus on southern Lebanon over 60 times since the war began in October.<br><br>

                Israel defended its use of white phosphorus, claiming it was in line with international law for creating smokescreens.<br><br>

                White phosphorus burns at extremely high temperatures and can stick to the skin, posing a potentially lethal threat. <br><br>

                Residents said that these shells “incinerated at least 4 homes.”<br><br>

                9 people were injured in the white phosphorus attack, including 3 who were hospitalized.

                Researchers showed participants images of a man’s buttocks from various angles with digitally altered proportions.<br><br>

                Over 2,000 men, mainly between 25 and 34 years old, participated in the survey, rating the attractiveness of the different buttock images.<br><br>

                Dr. Ashit Patel, a member surgeon of ASPS from Duke University: “Our results demonstrate that there is a preferred male gluteal aesthetic. The findings suggest that a moderately enhanced, well-proportioned appearance is most desirable. In our survey, raters thought the ideal male buttocks shouldn’t be flat, but also shouldn’t stick out too far. The buttocks shouldn’t be too wide, and should retain the characteristic dimple on the sides.”<br><br>

                The study also reported that there is a rising interest among men to get procedures like butt lifts.<br><br>

                These preferences differ from studies on the ideal female cheeks, which favored a rounder, fuller appearance.

                Harvard University President Claudine Gay will retain her position despite backlash over her comments regarding antisemitism.<br><br>

                The saga began when Gay, alongside presidents from MIT and UPenn, testified to Congress last week about a purported rise of “antisemitic” incidents on college campuses.<br><br>

                When Gay was asked if wishing for the genocide of Jews is restricted speech, she refused to answer “yes” or “no,” saying that it depends on the context.<br><br>

                This drew the ire of prominent Jewish donors, with reports that Harvard lost over $1 billion in donations since the testimony.<br><br>

                Gay has since apologized for her remarks, saying she “failed to convey what is my truth.”<br><br>

                Today, Harvard’s governing body released a statement saying they support Gay and will not vote for her resignation.<br><br>

                Americans like JP Stonestreet and Amelia Basista, who moved to Ecuador, express no regrets about moving and say they even lost 50 pounds.<br><br>

                Stonestreet: “I was really close to either dying or being paralyzed from neck down and we realized working towards a retirement we may never be able to afford wasn’t worth it. That was when we realized the American dream was dying - that it doesn’t exist any more. Many people are telling us they'll have to work until they die, they’re stuck in this cycle.”<br><br>

                An October poll found that only 36% of Americans still believe in the “American dream” that “if you work hard you’ll get ahead,” with many citing crippling debt, soaring house prices, and a “toxic hamster wheel” culture.
