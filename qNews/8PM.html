            <h3 class="hecho">Epstein Files Unsealed</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Hundreds of pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein were unsealed today, featuring names of accusers, celebrities, politicians, and more.<br><br>

                The documents come from a lawsuit against Epstein’s former girlfriend and partner-in-crime, Ghislaine Maxwell. They include depositions, police reports, and other court filings.<br><br>

                Prominent figures mentioned in the documents include:<br><br>

                Former President Bill Clinton<br><br>

                Former President Donald Trump<br><br>

                Former Vice President Al Gore<br><br>

                UK’s Prince Andrew<br><br>

                Stephen Hawking<br><br>

                Naomi Campbell<br><br>

                Kevin Spacey<br><br>

                Leonardo DiCaprio<br><br>

                George Lucas<br><br>

                Cameron Diaz<br><br>

                It’s important to emphasize that their inclusion does not necessarily imply wrongdoing; they could have merely been mentioned in passing.<br><br>

                For example, Stephen Hawking was mentioned by Epstein in an email to Maxwell. Epstein wrote that the physicist, who was disabled and used a wheelchair, had visited his private island, suggesting that would help him beat his child sex-trafficking allegations. “And the new version in the virgin islands that stven hawking partica-ted in an underage orgy,” Epstein wrote.<br><br>

                Other mentions are more damning.

            <h3 class="hecho">'Clinton Likes Them Young'</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Among the lowlights of the Epstein files is a testimony from one witness regarding former President Bill Clinton.<br><br>

                An interrogator asked the witness during a confidential conversation: “Do you know if Bill Clinton was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein?”<br><br>

                Witness: “I knew he had dealings with Bill Clinton. I did not know they were friends until I read the Vanity Fair article about them going to Africa together.”<br><br>

                Interrogator: “Did Jeffrey ever talk to you about Bill Clinton?”<br><br>

                Witness: “He said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls.”<br><br>

                When asked for comment, a Clinton Foundation spokesperson referred the media outlet The Messenger to a 2019 statement that said the former president "knew nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to... or those with which he has recently been charged.”

            <h3 class="hecho">Alan Dershowitz Accused Of Forced Sex</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Damning accusations in the Epstein files include those surrounding former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.<br><br>

                According to the documents: “One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein’s and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.”<br><br>

                Currently, Israel is considering hiring Dershowitz to represent the Jewish state against accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice. It’s unclear if these accusations will affect that consideration.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                93% U.S. high schools start earlier than the recommended 8:30 a.m., contributing to a lack of sleep and other health concerns in teens.<br><br>

                Louisiana has the earliest average start time at 7:30 a.m., while only Washington DC, Alaska, and South Carolina met the American Academy of Pediatrics’s recommended start time.<br><br>

                The early start times are largely due to issues like school bus schedules, with high schoolers typically being picked up first.<br><br>

                Sleep deprivation in teens is linked to poor academic performance, mood disorders, risky behaviors, car crashes, and physical health problems like obesity and diabetes.<br><br>

                Some states are advocating for later start times, with California leading the charge by mandating later starts for middle and high schools.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Young Thug has announced a new clothing line, “Act Normal,” on Instagram amid his RICO trial. <br><br>

                Young Thug posted a link to the line on his instagram story with the caption: “If you support me then…you know the rest.”<br><br>

                The Act Normal website features a minimalist black and brown design with a “Coming Soon” title, hinting at future collections and offering a newsletter subscription for updates and discounts.<br><br>

                The brand's Instagram is already up, with a classy logo and featured tagline: “Be the reason the world changes.”<br><br>

                “Manufactured in Paris” is also visible on the tag in the image.<br><br>

                Entrepreneur Isaiah GQ is reportedly involved with Act Normal, which is set to be a separate venture from Thug's existing Spider clothing line.<br><br>

                Act Normal Instagram caption: “When the world is in chaos we do what the rest of the world isn’t doing.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Three-time felon Deobra Redden fully leaped Judge Mary Kay Holthus during his sentencing in a Las Vegas courtroom, injuring her and a marshal.<br><br>

                The incident occurred as Redden was being sentenced for attempted battery, leading to a brawl.<br><br>

                Judge Holthus suffered a head injury but was reported to be okay. The injured marshal was also in stable condition.<br><br>

                Redden faces new charges of battery-on-a-protected-person, indicating the victim was “substantially harmed.”<br><br>

                Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson: “Thank God the judge is okay. Thank God for the heroic efforts of those who came to her aid, especially her marshal and her law clerk. Without them, the situation would have been much worse as this defendant exhibited extremely violent behavior and I’m confident there will be consequences.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Universal Pictures became the highest-grossing studio of 2023, earning $4.907 billion globally with successes like “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and “Oppenheimer.”<br><br>

                Disney, the previous leader since 2015, fell to second place, grossing $4.827 billion with films such as “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” and “The Little Mermaid.”<br><br>

                Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” ($1.4 billion) led the top three movies globally, with Universal's titles also in the top ranks, while Disney didn't have one in the top three for the first time since 2014.<br><br>

                Warner Bros., Sony, and Paramount followed in the global earnings, with Warner Bros. earning $3.84 billion and Sony and Paramount rounding out the top five.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Britney Spears has announced she would “never return to the music industry” in a new Instagram post.<br><br>

                “Just so we're clear, most of the news is trash!!! They keep saying I'm turning to random people to do a new album… I will never return to the music industry!!! When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people!!!”<br><br>

                She continued: “For those of you who have read my book, there's loads that you don't know about me… I've written over 20 songs for other people the past two years!!! I'm a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way!!! People are also saying MY BOOK WAS RELEASED WITHOUT MY APPROVAL ILLEGALLY and that's far from the truth… have you read the news these days??? I'm so LOVED and blessed!!!”<br><br>

                The post was accompanied by a photo of Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist, a famous painting by Guido Reni, an Italian artist from the Baroque period.<br><br>

                Spears' memoir “The Woman In Me,” topped the New York Times' best-seller list in October.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                While many CEO’s today are ramping up inclusivity, Lululemon's founder criticized the company for diversity efforts. Chip Wilson, worth $8.7 billion, insisted exclusivity trumps inclusivity.<br><br>

                Wilson, in an interview with Forbes: “They’re trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody. And I think the definition of a brand is that you’re not everything to everybody… You’ve got to be clear that you don’t want certain customers coming in.”<br><br>

                In November 2020, the company formed a new department named the Inclusion Diversity, Equity, and Action department. However, allegations of tokenism and bias in hiring practices continue.<br><br>

                Lululemon said it “has made considerable progress since launching IDEA, and we are proud of the goals we have achieved, which include maintaining a continuous two-way dialogue with our people.”<br><br>

                Wilson has seen his net worth grow by almost $4 billion since 2020, almost entirely from the rise in value of his 8% stake in Lululemon stock.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Shia LaBeouf has been confirmed into the Catholic Church by Bishop Robert Barron.<br><br>

                He began exploring the diaconate while filming “Padre Pio,” where he played the titular role and felt a connection to the Catholic faith.<br><br>

                His confirmation was announced by the Capuchin Franciscans-Western American Province on Facebook: “We are thrilled to share that our dear friend Shia LaBeouf has fully entered the Church this past weekend through the sacrament of confirmation. The Capuchin Franciscan friars are overjoyed to welcome him into the fold and witness his deep commitment to his faith journey.”<br><br>

                LaBeouf is considering becoming a deacon “sometime in the future.”<br><br>

                In his interview with Barron, LaBeouf spoke about his view of Jesus prior to his having read the Gospels as someone who is “soft, fragile, all-loving, all-listening” but with “no ferocity, no romance.” What he encountered in the Gospels was a very different, masculine Christ, he said.<br><br>

                After the film’s completion, LaBeouf told CNA that playing the role of the saint while being immersed in his monastery and town added to the intensity.<br><br>

                LaBeouf: “It’s enormous pressure, but it only served the film. There are scenes where we’re running Mass and these aren’t actors in the seats. These are God-fearing people who love Pio and you feel it, and it only adds to the stakes.”

            <h3 class="hecho">Scientists Can Now Teleport Images</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists in South Africa and Spain have successfully teleported images using light, with researchers calling it “a ‘Star Trek’ technology made real.”<br><br>

                The team achieved the feat using laser light patterns and an optical detector that harnessed quantum processes. Essentially, some principles of quantum physics allow information about an image to appear on the receiver’s end without having to physically travel from the sender.<br><br>

                Andrew Forbes, a professor who led the research: “Traditionally, two communicating parties physically send the information from one to the other, even in the quantum realm. Now, it’s possible to teleport information so that it never physically travels across the connection—a ‘Star Trek’ technology made real.”<br><br>

                Notably, the scientists warned that this technology could be used nefariously to produce clones.<br><br>

                Adam Vallés, researcher: “We have to be cautious now, as this configuration could not prevent a cheating sender from keeping better copies of the information to be teleported, which means we could end up with many Mr. Spock clones in the Star Trek world if that is what Scotty wanted.”<br><br>

                The achievement offers a glimpse at the potential of quantum communications, an emerging field that could allow data to be sent across distances far greater than modern telecommunication systems currently offer.

                Jimmy Kimmel is pushing back after New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers suggested in an interview that the late-night talk show will appear on the Epstein associates list, which is expected to be unsealed this week.<br><br>

                In an interview with Pat McAfee today, Rodgers said: “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, who are really hoping that doesn't come out… I'll tell you what, if that list comes out, I definitely will be popping some sort of bottle.”<br><br>

                In a new indictment, Menendez is accused of a bribery and extortion scheme that continued into 2023.

                Yesterday, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated Japan's western coast, resulting in 48 deaths and widespread damage, including three-foot-high tsunamis. This event eerily aligns with Nostradamus’ apocalyptic prophecy and Japanese myths about the Doomsday Fish.<br><br>

                Nostradamus, a 16th-century French astrologer, predicted in 2024 that “the dry Earth will become more parched, and there will be great floods.”<br><br>

                The disaster prompted a massive rescue operation, with a 3,000-strong team of army, firefighters, and police dispatched to the Noto peninsula.<br><br>

                Over the summer, an injured giant oarfish, known in Japanese mythology as a harbinger of earthquakes, was spotted in Taiwan, further fueling superstitions linked to the quake.<br><br>

                The 17-year-old was manipulated into isolating himself in rural Utah, where scammers convinced his family he had been abducted. Once the teenager was alone in the wilderness, the “kidnappers” sent a ransom demand and a picture to his parents in China and claimed he had been abducted. The student had even taken the picture himself.<br><br>

                Joseph Steinberg, cyber security expert: “The technology has reached a point where even loving parents who know their kids really well can be tricked. Cyber crime is probably the crime that pays the best. You can target people in different languages. You can do it from anywhere. The reality is that we know that people just like us… have fallen prey.”<br><br>

                Marie-Helen Maras, director of the Center for Cybercrime Studies: “Criminals can even spoof numbers to make it look like it's coming from you. They are becoming increasingly better at obscuring the fraud.”

                A $12 billion biomedical research firm in Texas bought over 500 acres, with plans to house up to 43,200 monkeys. Now, neighbors want them out.<br><br>

                “How much racket does 43,000 monkeys make?” asked Jason Robert, a shrimper who owns about 1,100 acres near the plot. “I’m sure they’re not quiet.”<br><br>

                “I thought this would be a place to get away from everything,” said John Stern, a retired veterinarian who built a retreat on about 900 acres for his family and grandchildren. “Now a monkey farm is my neighbor.”<br><br>

                The firm, Charles River Laboratories, sells the animals for research and, under contract to universities, biotech, and pharma companies, runs tests on the animals in its own facilities. In 2022, the company housed nearly 19,000 monkeys in half a dozen states.<br><br>

                Since early October, PETA has canvassed county officials and conservation groups, and it has mailed more than 4,000 letters to local residents to oppose the project, citing the possible spread of diseases and the possibility of contaminated soil and water.<br><br>

                Following the revolt, Charles River Laboratories put its monkey business on hold. “At the current time our plans are on hold,” its chief operating officer told The Wall Street Journal. “We didn’t do our job,” expressing regret that the company didn’t connect with the community.

                Karl Holden, former coach: “He went from under-10s to under-14 leagues and, before he was 11, he was playing in the under-21s, just simply because he was too good for anybody else.”<br><br>

                Southern England is struggling with escalating costs impacting the fish and chips industry, potentially leading to a shortage of the iconic British food.<br><br>

                The war in Ukraine has significantly raised the cost of diesel to power the fishing boats, sunflower oil to fry the fish, and electricity to run the fryers, which are all crucial for fishing and preparing fish and chips. As a result, the cost of fish has soared, with a bag of fish that used to cost a couple of pounds now priced per fish.<br><br>

                The National Federation of Fish Friers predicts up to a third of the UK's 10,500 chippies may close, while Sarson's, a malt vinegar maker, estimates up to half might shut down. This threatens a billion-dollar industry and a cultural staple.<br><br>

                Gen Z is seeing homeownership as less of an aspiration, with many choosing to rent in luxury amenity-filled apartments instead.<br><br>

                Take Scranton, Pennsylvania, for instance. The Wall Street Journal revealed that homes there are listed at a median price of $179,900. With a $150,000, 30-year mortgage at a 7% rate, the average monthly payment would sit near $1,000.<br><br>

                Despite the affordable price, young people in Scranton are opting for luxury apartments. Scranton project property manager Michael Basalyga said around 1,000 people would like to rent 32 luxury apartments built inside the Scranton Lace Factory's converted living spaces, which run between $950 and $3,600 monthly. Two-thirds of the units were pre-leased as of December.<br><br>

                Analysts emphasize the shift is driven by cultural rather than financial factors. For instance, real estate investor GID, which owns or manages around 50,000 apartments in the U.S., said nearly a quarter of its renters earn over $200,000.<br><br>

                This all occurs as 64% of people in the U.S. are homeowners, which is lower than the rate in China (89%) and Brazil (72%).

                People over 50 who live alone may be able to counter decline in their verbal cognition by adding a pet to their home, according to a new study.<br><br>

                The study analyzed data from people aged 50 and older who lived with pets. The participants took a test that “assesses the person’s ability to pay attention to the words, encode the words, and recall them later,” a researcher said.<br><br>

                Pet ownership was associated with slower rates of decline in an overall score of verbal cognition, verbal memory, and fluency if a person lived alone, but not if they lived with other people. Researchers are still puzzled by that last part and don’t know why that’s the case.<br><br>

                Ciyong Lu, researcher: “The companionship provided by pets can reduce loneliness and increase well-being,” adding that “watching pets can help people calm, relax, and relieve stress and anxiety.”<br><br>

                In addition, pets can provide owners with opportunities to meet new people and have conversations while taking walks, Lu said. According to the study, pet owners had a lower social isolation score than non-pet owners.<br><br>

                Another factor is sleep quality: “Pet owners fall asleep more easily than non-pet owners. For example, dog owners often walk their dogs before bedtime, which may have a relaxing effect on the owners and make it easier for them to fall asleep,” noted Lu.

                Britni Ricard owns an apartment building with ten units, with many of the tenants being single women with children. She says the women reminded her of growing up in public housing when she was a child, and how difficult affording Christmas presents was for her mom.<br><br>

                Ricard: “It was tough. My mom was a single woman raising three children alone, and watching her continuously struggle as a child and wanting to figure out, 'How can I help?'"<br><br>

                In November, Ricard gathered her tenants for a pre-holiday meeting and gave them the good news: they wouldn’t have to pay for rent for a month.<br><br>

                Kedesha Dunn, who lives in one of the units with her two boys, said the gift would allow her family to celebrate Christmas to the fullest.<br><br>

                Dunn: “I'm an emotional person. I start to cry. 'Cause I'm just like, that is so sweet. She's uh, better than Santa Claus at this point. ... Like a guardian angel.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A pornstar has volunteered to be the first person to receive Elon Musk’s brain chip.<br><br>

                Kayla Kayden has described Neuralink as “botox for the brain,” saying she wants to be the first recipient so she can be a “hybrid human.”<br><br>

                Kayden, speaking with NudePR.com: “People use botox for their face, this would be the same but for the brain. I won’t have to worry about the effects of aging on my brain. As a hybrid human, the possibilities are endless.”<br><br>

                She emphasized she has very valid reasons for getting the implant: “I have very bad vision. I’ve been in glasses/contacts since I was very young. I am legally blind, I’m -6.5 with astigmatism.”<br><br>

                The comments come after Kayla previously made headlines after getting an instant 24-hour boob job with saltwater injections.<br><br>

                Neuralink aims to create a human-computer interface, with human trials planned for the next six years.

                2023 was filled with typical stories—political scandals, geopolitical crises, celebrity drama. But there were also ones that made everyone pause for a moment and ask: “What?” Here are a few of those.<br><br>

                Mexican aliens: A ufologist presented to Mexico’s Congress what he said were corpses of real-life aliens. He announced that the bodies were more than 1,000 years old and were discovered buried between the Peruvian cities of Palpa and Nazca in 2017. Scientists are now studying these bodies, claiming they had “eggs” inside of them.<br><br>

                TikTok’s NPC trend: TikTok users started live-streaming themselves acting like video game NPCs. For hours on end, they repeated lines of dialogue, pretended to eat food, and interacted with users as if they were in a video game. Some of these streamers made thousands of dollars a day.<br><br>

                “That person is not real”: A female airline passenger was filmed emotionally trying to leave a plane, saying a man sitting next to her resembled a lizard. The woman, identified later as Tiffany Gomas, has since apologized for her public outburst, refusing to say what caused it. She now appears on podcasts and gives business advice.

                Viral videos of customers highlighting how expensive McDonald’s and other fast food joints have gotten have made it to the Biden administration. Now, the White House is developing a plan to combat what it says is “disinformation.”<br><br>

                According to the White House, memes about McDonald’s meals reaching as high as $16 due to inflation is “one of their most vexing challenges ahead of the 2024 presidential election,” reports The Washington Post.<br><br>

                The plan to combat this “disinformation” remains unclear, but TikTok will likely be in the spotlight, as that is where most of this content is spreading. Some economists think this content is “dangerous” because it affects polling, as seen in Biden’s declining economic approval.<br><br>

                The Washington Post: “These economists fear that these exaggerated stories will ultimately lead to a worse outcome — perhaps helping Trump win reelection — and that it is vital to make clear that this remains by many measures one of the best recoveries in modern U.S. history.”

                Pentagon officials announced at a conference this week that the U.S. government is considering the possibility of cybernetic super soldiers directly inspired by “RoboCop” and superheroes like Captain America and Iron Man.<br><br>

                The ideas floated include synthetic blood and replacing night vision goggles with eye drops, two projects the Pentagon is actively working on.<br><br>

                A slide in a presentation showed a “soldier of the future” whose body is “flooded with pain-numbing stimulants” and has the “ability to regrow limbs & quickly heal wounds like a lizard.”<br><br>

                The slide included the quote: “Enhanced soldiers would be reduced to bionic men, who run fast, do not need to sleep, eat and drink very little, and can fight all the time. A new species is born: Homo robocopus.”<br><br>

                Some ethical concerns were discussed, such as where we should draw the line between human and robot, but the officials agreed that if other countries are pursuing the mission of human perfection, America must be at the forefront.<br><br>

                George Matook, U.S. Army Developmental Command Representative: “We could find ourselves in a situation where our soldiers, as talented and trained as they are, are facing an unfair fight because another country is willing to say, ‘Hey, guess what, you, male, are a good aviator.

                The poll comes as Russia yesterday launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the conflict began, killing 30 civilians. In response, Ukraine attacked Russia with strikes that allegedly included cluster bombs, killing 14 and injuring 108, according to Russian officials.

                The model, called life2vec, uses data from a national register of six million people. It analyzes detailed personal data and can conclude how someone might think, feel, and behave, alongside their survival probabilities over four years.<br><br>

                Sune Lehmann, lead researcher: “With that data, we can make any kind of prediction.”<br><br>

                In an October survey, only 36% of respondents said they still believe in the American dream that “if you work hard you'll get ahead.” With opportunities for remote work and greater affordability, leaving the country is seen by many as an alluring option.<br><br>

It just takes one unforeseen incident ... to completely change that and take the dream away from you.”<br><br>

                Researchers are grappling with how to train the AI in self-driving vehicles for moral decision-making. They’ve scrapped the conventional trolley problem, focusing instead on more realistic traffic scenarios and moral judgments.<br><br>

                In a study, researchers created seven different driving scenarios, such as a parent who has to decide whether to violate a traffic signal while trying to get their child to school on time.<br><br>

                They then created different versions of each scenario. For instance, in one version of the scenario where a parent is trying to get the child to school, the parent is caring, brakes at a yellow light, and gets the child to school on time. In another version, the parent is reckless, runs a red light, and causes an accident.<br><br>

                Dario Cecchini, researcher: “The goal here is to have study participants view one version of each scenario and determine how moral the behavior of the driver was in each scenario, on a scale from one to 10. This will give us robust data on what we consider moral behavior in the context of driving a vehicle, which can then be used to develop AI algorithms for moral decision-making in autonomous vehicles.”

The military needs 200,000 enlistees annually but is expected to only have about 125,000 by this time.<br><br>

                Biden is warning that the U.S. is at risk of entering a direct conflict with Russia if Putin is victorious against Ukraine. The president’s statement came hours after Russia launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the conflict began in February 2022, killing 30 civilians.<br><br>

                Biden: “Overnight, Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since this war began. It is a stark reminder to the world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin's objective remains unchanged. He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped.”<br><br>

                “The stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. They affect the entirety of the NATO alliance, the security of Europe, and the future of the transatlantic relationship. When dictators and autocrats are allowed to run roughshod in Europe, the risk rises that the United States gets pulled in directly. And the consequences reverberate around the world. We cannot let our allies and partners down. We cannot let Ukraine down. History will judge harshly those who fail to answer freedom's call.”<br><br>

                The White House approved a final $250 million aid package for Ukraine this week. Biden stated that unless congressional lawmakers take “urgent action in the new year,” the U.S. will not be able to continue to provide Ukraine with “weapons and vital air defense systems.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Dubai is using new technology to enhance rainfall and augment water sources, addressing a growing need in its desert environment as its population surges.<br><br>

                The technology, cloud seeding, involves adding chemical compounds, like silver iodide, into clouds to induce rain. The chemical particles are spread via plane or drone into supercooled clouds that are below the freezing point of water, functioning as a surface around which water droplets can form.<br><br>

                As more water droplets condense around this surface, they begin to form ice crystals. These crystals begin to grow quickly as the surrounding water vapor latches onto the crystals, producing snowflakes and descending as rain from the clouds.<br><br>

                This method dates back to the 1940s and saw extensive use during the 1990s. Dubai's population has surged from less than a million in 2002 to over 3.5 million in 2022, intensifying the need for water in its dry environment.

                Forest City is a $100 billion project in Malaysia, built by China's largest property developer Country Garden in 2016, and was intended to house 1 million people.<br><br>

                The city envisioned an eco-friendly metropolis featuring a golf course, waterpark, offices, bars, and restaurants.<br><br>

                At the time of construction, China’s property market was in full force—now, however, only 15% of the project is completed, and just over 1% is occupied.<br><br>

                Former resident Nazmi Hanafiah described it as "lonely" and "creepy,” adding: “I managed to escape this place. I didn't care about my deposit, I didn't care about the money. I just had to get out. I'm getting goosebumps just being back. It's lonely around here—it's just you and your thoughts.”<br><br>

                Aimed at the Chinese market for investment and second homes, its high prices were unaffordable for most Malaysians.<br><br>

                The city’s future is uncertain amid China's property crisis and local political factors in Malaysia.<br><br>

                Still, Country Garden told the BBC that it is “optimistic” the city will return to glory.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Officials in Gaza are accusing Israel of harvesting organs from deceased Palestinians, claiming that dozens of bodies were discovered with notable alterations and missing organs.<br><br>

                These officials say Israeli forces returned dozens of bodies without identifying the dead or disclosing their origins. An examination of the bodies revealed that there were significant changes made to them with signs of the theft of organs from corpses, Gaza media said in a statement, urging for an international investigation.<br><br>

                The bodies are believed to belong to Palestinians who were either detained by Israeli forces during ground operations and then killed, or their bodies were seized after being killed in attacks. <br><br>

                Officials emphasized that there had been previous incidents of bodies missing organs since Israel’s actions in Gaza began. Last month, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor called for the creation of an independent international committee into suspected organ theft.

            <h3 class="hecho">Scientists Hype Up Transparent Wood</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists have set their sights on a new material they think has a lot of promise: transparent wood.

                The material’s possibilities range from producing super-strong screens for smartphones to being used in soft, glowing light fixtures and color-changing windows.<br><br>

                To create transparent wood, scientists first need to modify or get rid of the glue, called lignin, that holds the cell bundles together and provides trunks and branches with most of their earthy brown hues.<br><br>

                After bleaching lignin’s color away or otherwise removing it, a milky-white skeleton of hollow cells remains. Scientists then fill the air pockets with a substance like epoxy resin that bends light to render the wood transparent.<br><br>

                Researchers emphasize that the resulting tiny wood fibers are stronger than the best carbon fibers, even outperforming plastic and glass. In experiments, transparent wood came out around 3 times stronger than transparent plastics like Plexiglass and about 10 times tougher than glass.<br><br>

                The findings suggest that transparent wood could even be helpful in energy-efficient buildings, aiding in temperature control better than traditional glass.

                Around 44 million options contracts have swapped hands each day in 2023, an annual record based on data going back to 1973.<br><br>

                The surge in trading suggests investors are eager to take on big risks in the market, especially in emerging spheres like AI. For instance, Nvidia options volume surged 60% from last year after the AI frenzy fueled intense interest.<br><br>

                Speculators are also more than ever placing their hopes in short-term, 24-hour options, that promise big gains with a low chance, akin to a lottery ticket. In October, the share of trading in contracts that expire in 5 or fewer days reached a record 59%, suggesting many traders are holding positions for short moments in hopes of rapid gains.<br><br>

                Tom Sosnoff, co-founder of the retail brokerage Tastytrade, told The Wall Street Journal that people are seeking the best bang for their buck, expecting avenues like sports betting to grow in interest. “Everybody’s betting on everything,” he said.

                At around midnight in Kahala, Hawaii, someone heard a woman's screams and witnessed her giving birth on a sidewalk. The person called 911 after witnessing the woman abandon her baby in a trash can and immediately rescued the infant.<br><br>

                The baby remains in a serious condition, and Honolulu Police are still investigating the incident. According to Hawaii state Rep. John Mizuna, the situation could have been avoided if the homeless woman had known about the state’s safe haven laws.<br><br>

                Hawaii's 2007 safe haven laws allow for the legal surrender of newborns within 72 hours of birth at designated places without fear of prosecution.<br><br>

                The hero: “Just in the moment, I was in shock a little bit. Really no words. I broke down a little bit and started crying because I didn’t know how someone could just leave their kid like that.The last thing I heard, the baby was in stable condition. I’m grateful to God that I was here home when this all happened so that I was able to get the kid in time to save its life. It could have turned out very different if I didn’t hear the screams and I wasn’t home.”<br><br>

                Rep. John Mizuna: “Our people need to know that we have a vehicle for the relinquishment of unwanted newborns.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Maine’s secretary of state has announced the state is disqualifying Trump from its 2024 ballot, becoming the second state to find the former president ineligible to run for re-election.<br><br>

                Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, accused Trump of inciting insurrection on January 6, 2021, rendering him ineligible from the presidency under the Fourteenth Amendment. This was the same conclusion that the Colorado Supreme Court arrived at last week.<br><br>

                Bellows emphasized in her decision that “no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment.” But she added that she is “also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection.”<br><br>

                Importantly, Bellows’ office said her decision would not be enforced until the courts weigh in, given the unprecedented nature and the importance of the case.<br><br>

                Following the Colorado decision, the Colorado GOP appealed the decision, sending it to the U.S. Supreme Court and allowing Trump to return to the state’s ballot, at least for now. Likely, the Maine decision will similarly be challenged.<br><br>

                Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said that Trump’s legal team “will quickly file a legal objection in state court to prevent this atrocious decision in Maine from taking effect.”

                Industries dropping degree requirements include: 72% of information services, 62% software, 61% finance and insurance, 55% construction, 42% healthcare and social assistance, and 35% education.<br><br>

                In October, Walmart eliminated college degrees as a requirement for hundreds of its corporate roles, saying it would get rid of “unnecessary barriers.”

                Additionally, people are buying homes at least a decade later in life in California, Hawaii, New York, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi, compared to 1980. Only one state, Alaska, has homeowners getting younger.<br><br>

                Median home values have nearly doubled over the past decade despite household incomes only growing by 13.5% during the same period. A poll from September found almost 20% of millennials and Gen Z think they will never own a home, with many opting to live with their parents instead.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan marked five years in Russian detention today.<br><br>

                Whelan was arrested in Moscow on December 28, 2018, when he visited Russia for a friend’s wedding, he says. He was imprisoned on charges of espionage that he has vehemently denied.<br><br>

                In May 2020, the U.S. State Department designated Whelan was wrongfully detained. A month later, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison, which he has been serving at a remote prison camp.<br><br>

                In a call with CNN today, Whelan called on Biden to “please use every resource available to secure my release as you would do if your own son had been taken hostage.”<br><br>

                Whelan: “I’m more than past ready to return home and I’m counting on the U.S. government to come for me and soon. The time is now to take decisive action and bring this debacle to a close.”<br><br>

                “I would ask President Biden to pull out the stops, cross the red lines, and do whatever needs to be done to get this case resolved and to get me home. If my life is not worth that effort, then I don’t know what is.”<br><br>

                Whelan conveyed a feeling of abandonment, as two other Americans, Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner, were released from Russia in a prisoner swap last year.<br><br>

                “I am wondering what they’re going to do next. If there’s no diplomatic solution, what comes next? What are they prepared to do to honor that promise to get me home? If they’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping that something sticks and they can come up with a quick agreement, that’s not a very good policy.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Democrat strategists are sounding the alarm on the threat that third-party candidates pose to the 2024 presidential election, believing they may steal momentum from Biden and ultimately help Trump.<br><br>

                While independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West are unlikely to win the White House, they could chip away at Democrats who sympathize with a left-wing economic message but have grown unsatisfied with Biden’s performance as president, especially regarding his handling of the Israel conflict.<br><br>

                Notably, West’s plan includes appealing to Muslim voters in the swing state of Michigan, a key demographic to Biden’s victory in 2020. Losing just a fraction of these voters could scramble the election in 2024.<br><br>

                One Democratic strategist told NBC News: “I think folks just aren’t fully dialed in yet to how serious this risk is. It’s a big deal. If you look at the risk that this poses, there will be no choice but to forcefully and strongly push back on it.”<br><br>

                In September, reports emerged that Hillary Clinton told Biden to take the third-party threat seriously, with a source close to the conversation telling NBC News: “It’s pretty fucking concerning.”<br><br>

                Tony Lyons, a Kennedy surrogate, points to a poll that finds 60% of voters would support a third-party candidate: “This is a pretty unique historical moment when more than 60% of the population says they’re open to voting for a third-party or independent candidate.”<br><br>

                Meanwhile, the Republican side appears to not be as worried, with Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita emphasizing, “All of the elements of the third-party run are coming out of [Biden’s] coalition, not ours.”

                The study, conducted by the non-profit Environmental Working Group, analyzed 73 products and detected pesticides such as acetamiprid and captan, which are harmful to both bees and humans. Apple-based products, in particular, showed high levels of pesticide residue. <br><br>

                Sydney Evans, a senior science analyst: “Babies and young children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks posed by pesticides in food, and food is the way most children will be exposed to pesticides. Any pesticide residue in baby food is concerning, but parents should feel reassured that some of the most toxic chemicals we found in our 1995 study are no longer being detected.”

                The funds would aim to reduce income inequality in the state, being used to pay for pursuits like college, a home, or starting a business. The proposed amounts vary by household income, with the lowest-income families potentially accruing $46,215 by age 18.<br><br>

                Connecticut pioneered the policy, followed by California. The program could cost Massachusetts about $52 million annually, benefiting an estimated 8,000 infants each year.<br><br>

                Democrat Senator Paul Feeley, who introduced the program: “By investing at the start of a child's life, we are providing a jump-start to individuals otherwise at a disadvantage by beginning to narrow the racial wealth gap and giving our most vulnerable residents a fighting shot at the middle class and the American Dream.”<br><br>

                Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, who is set to oversee the program: “Hopefully it will be a priority, and it will receive the kind of funding it needs.” She emphasized that it would help alleviate “generational poverty” in the state.

It’s just so not natural. … I mentioned this when we talked in a very offhand way and he got a bit too defensive. And I know if I’m right, it doesn’t change anything. We can’t let AI speak on things when it comes to matters of the heart.”<br><br>

                AI tools that help people write emotional texts have existed for quite some time, such as an app called “Rizz App” that claims to generate flirtatious texts.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Merriam-Webster has announced that “authentic” is its word for 2023, noting the word has seen a “substantial increase” in search traffic this year, especially due to stories about AI, celebrity culture, and social media.<br><br>

                Merriam-Webster: “Authentic has a number of meanings including ‘not false or imitation,’ a synonym of real and actual; and also ‘true to one’s own personality, spirit, or character.’ Although clearly a desirable quality, authentic is hard to define and subject to debate—two reasons it sends many people to the dictionary.”<br><br>

                Merriam-Webster editor at large Peter Sokolowski told The Associated Press: “We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity. What we realize is that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.”<br><br>

                Other words that made the dictionary’s shortlist include “rizz,” “deepfake,” and “dystopian.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                China is on track with an ambitious renewable energy project, aiming to build 225 huge green energy bases in its remote deserts by the end of this decade.<br><br>

                These projects are anticipated to add 455 gigawatts of clean energy generation capacity, leveraging regions like the Kubuqi and Gobi deserts known for their ample sunshine and steady winds.<br><br>

                The deployment is part of President Xi Jinping's strategy to reduce China's reliance on fossil fuels and move toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. This may help China achieve peak emissions before its 2030 target, aiding in the global fight against rising temperatures.<br><br>

                The initiative is a model for other nations at COP28, where global leaders are urged to triple renewable energy capacity to meet climate goals.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Pope.L, a renowned artist known for his daring performances and conceptual art, has passed away at 68 in his Chicago home.<br><br>

                His work spans over four decades, focusing on the concept of race, language, and the condition of African Americans through sculptures, installations, and performances.<br><br>

                He was famous for his “crawl” performances, where he traversed distances on his hands and knees, addressing issues of success, suffering, and “Blackness.” His most notable crawl was a 22-mile journey from Manhattan to the Bronx, symbolizing a quest for freedom.<br><br>

                Pope.L's work often challenged viewers' perceptions of race and identity, with projects like the “Black Factory,” where he collected objects associated with “Blackness” from the public. He gained wide acclaim, shown in venues like the Whitney Biennial and Documenta, and was celebrated as “the greatest performance artist of our time.”<br><br>

                Pope.L, in a 1996 interview with Martha Wilson: “There are societal limitations to how much one can reconstruct one’s conditions. We are born into whiteness. On the surface, it seems wholly to construct us, and the degree to which we may counter-construct sometimes seems very limited. But, I believe we can be very imaginative with limitations.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A man who lost use of both of his hands and left leg has received a life-changing, first-of-its-kind surgery to revitalize his body.<br><br>

                Five months ago, 55-year-old Marcello Gaviglio was riding to work on his moped and suffered severe injuries after a motorcycle crashed into him.<br><br>

                Now, surgeons at an Italian hospital have used a new strategy in hopes of helping him recover from the injuries. Doctors took his sciatic nerve, which connects from the lower back through the legs, and transplanted it to nerves in his shoulder that connect the arm to the spine. Damage in this region is responsible for Gaviglio’s paralyzation.<br><br>

                Since his left leg was amputated, doctors said that part of his sciatic nerve is not in use. They hope to move the nerve to a part of his body that could use it more.<br><br>

                The operation was performed on December 21 and Gaviglio will take five months of physical therapy to restore feeling and movement to his hands. He still cannot use his limbs currently.<br><br>

                The team says this is the first surgery of this kind to be attempted, and hope their findings can help the world learn more about how the nervous system works.<br><br>

                Doctor Paulo Titolo: “We think this is pioneering surgery because if it works it means that the brain plasticity can control other parts of the body that we didn't expect and also opens new fields in neuro studies.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A high school in China has won 2023’s World Building of the Year at the World Architecture Festival.<br><br>

                Huizhen High School features a “floating forest” with elevated walkways. The body is a large, open square with a calming white design and earthy tones inside.<br><br>

                The project was praised for its innovative “efficiency-first” campus design, blending education with nature, and aims to inspire “free thinking” with open-air lecture halls and tree-lined pathways.<br><br>

                In its project description, the firm behind the school said its design was intended to let students “release stress, adjust their body and mind and discover beauty” outside the classroom.<br><br>

                The coveted World Building of the Year title is considered one of the architecture profession’s top accolades and is decided at the annual festival by a 140-strong expert panel. This school was commended by the judges for breaking conventional school design.<br><br>

                Paul Finch, WAF’s program director: “The architects managed to create a school which is very different than the usual model, where students are boxed in and put under teaching—as well as architectural—pressure. By contrast, this design encourages walking, fresh air, and the possibility of relief from academic intensity.”

                CBS News reporter Catherine Herridge said for 2024 she predicts a “black swan” event—a major, unpredictable event that shocks the world but is predictable in hindsight.<br><br>

                Herridge said on live TV: “I just feel a lot of concern that 2024 may be the year of a black swan event. This is a national security event with a high impact that's very hard to predict. There are a number of concerns that I have that factor into that, not only this sort of enduring heightened threat level that we're facing, the wars in Israel, also Ukraine. And we're so divided in this country in ways that we haven't seen before. And I think that just creates fertile ground for our adversaries like North Korea, China, and Iran. And that's what concerns me most.”<br><br>

                Margaret Brennan, the host, agreed: “A lot of people are up at night with that concern, Catherine. At least in this town.”<br><br>

                A black swan event can also be positive, but in this context Herridge asserted that it would have negative consequences for America. Past events could include 9/11, the 2008 global financial crash, and Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election.

                Khosla: “I do think in ten years we'll have free doctors, free tutors for everybody, and free lawyers so they can access the legal system. I also forecast in 25 years we will have a billion bipedal robots. That will create a massive industry larger than today's auto industry. My bet is we'll have more than a million in less than ten years.”<br><br>

                Khosla emphasized that humans should not be scared of AI and should instead view the technology as a necessary step for progress: “Too many people are looking at the dystopian angle of this 1% probability of something bad happening and ignoring the benefits to humanity of AI. This large transformation is the opportunity to free humanity from the need to work. People will work when they want to work on what they want to work on.”<br><br>

                Khosla’s sentiment aligns with a growing movement in Silicon Valley called effective accelerationism, which argues technological progress must be front and center to benefit humanity, regardless of the short-term harm it may do to aspects of society, like employment.

                Notably, the law was quietly passed—there was barely a mention in Cuba’s state-run media and no public debate. The decision has sparked a wider conversation about end-of-life choices in a predominantly Catholic country, with the Cuban Roman Catholic Church yet to comment.<br><br>

                Suaima Lopez, nurse: “Families want to keep loved ones alive until the very, very last moment but one has to think of those suffering. If only we could have a dignified death ... let me die peacefully, in peace and harmony.”<br><br>

                Euthanasia is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany, New Zealand, and some states in the U.S. It’s especially popular in Canada, making up 7% of all deaths in Quebec.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In 2023, major banks like UBS and Wells Fargo collectively slashed over 60,000 jobs, marking one of the most significant workforce reductions since the 2008 financial crisis.<br><br>

                The move was largely driven by plummeting investment banking fees and the need to protect profit margins.<br><br>

                The largest cuts came from UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse, leading to at least 13,000 fewer roles. Other major banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, contributed to the 30,000 additional layoffs.<br><br>

                These reductions, affecting less than 5% of the total workforce for most banks, came after a pause due to COVID. Some banks like HSBC and Commerzbank avoided layoffs in 2023, while others like UK's Metro Bank planned to cut a fifth of their workforce.<br><br>

                The outlook for 2024 remains pessimistic, with expectations of continued conservative hiring strategies amid a decline in investment banking activities and a cautious approach to dealmaking.

                The Italian Space Agency and a French space startup are collaborating to create the Multi-Purpose Habitat, which would serve as the first permanent human outpost on the Moon.<br><br>

                This development aligns with NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the Moon by late 2025 and later construct a permanent habitat in the 2030s.<br><br>

                The habitat is still in the design phase, with a render suggesting a cylindrical shape, powered by solar panels, and articulated legs to prevent rolling. Its purpose is to provide a pressurized environment, life support, and protection from radiation and micrometeorite showers.<br><br>

                In 2020, the Italian Space Agency signed a “joint statement of intention” in NASA's Artemis Program, signaling a “mutual desire to further develop cooperative lunar exploration activities, with a specific focus on returning humans to the surface of the Moon.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Tucker Carlson dropped a surprise interview with Kevin Spacey today, during which the actor portrays his beloved “House of Cards” character, corrupt politician Frank Underwood.<br><br>

                Carlson titled the seven-minute interview “a Christmas Eve election surprise,” with many wondering if the bit was to simply troll the Internet or if it was meant to convey a deeper, subtle message. Spacey was the target of nine charges of sexual impropriety, including seven counts of sexual assault, until he was acquitted of all of them in July.<br><br>

                At one point in the interview, Carlson asks Spacey, who has lost all associations with Netflix, how he feels about the streaming giant using the sound of Frank Underwood knocking on wood as its intro sound when someone opens the app.<br><br>

                Spacey: “It is bizarre they decided to publicly cut ties with me on allegations alone, allegations that have now been proven false. Because I don’t think there’s any question. Netflix exists because of me. I put them on the map, and they tried to put me in the ground.”<br><br>

                One user on X speculated about the interview: “This interview makes no sense, until you consider something: Kevin Spacey is linked to Epstein. In his bizarre ‘Call Me Frank’ videos he hints that he has major blackmail on people. I think Tucker having Spacey on his show is meant as a warning to someone.”<br><br>

                The connection to Jeffrey Epstein is notable, as a judge ruled last week to release Epstein’s client list to the public on January 1.

                Members of Gen Z are so annoyed they can’t afford homes that they are “doom spending” on luxury items to feel like adults.<br><br>

                A report from Intuit Credit Karma found more than 25% of all Americans are partaking in this practice, with a record 200 million shoppers turning out between Black Friday and Cyber Monday despite inflation and high-interest rates squeezing rates. Holiday spending is expected to hit record levels, totaling up to $966.6 billion.<br><br>

                Among these “doom spenders,” no group is more vocally supportive of it than Gen Z.<br><br>

                Maria Melchor, a 27-year-old financial content creator on TikTok: “When older people ask me how young people are affording nice things that they wouldn’t even buy for themselves. I tell them it’s because we can’t afford anything else.”<br><br>

                “Homeownership or starting a family is so out of reach that we’re using that down payment or kid money on whatever it is we can afford that’ll bring us a semblance of the kind of adulthood we were promised. When houses are a million dollar plus and an older couple will likely outbid us anyway, we’re gonna relinquish any lingering delusions about homeownership,” she added.<br><br>

                One user on TikTok agreed: “My mother asking me when I’m gonna stop traveling and buy a house. I can’t afford a house but I can travel.”<br><br>

                Another user wrote: “I just tell myself I deserve to enjoy life right now since it’s gonna go to hell pretty soon anyway.”

                Just days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Biden called Netanyahu for 45 minutes and convinced him not to launch strikes on the Lebanese group Hezbollah, likely preventing an all-out Middle East war.<br><br>

                Sources familiar with the phone call told The Wall Street Journal that Israeli warplanes were in the air and ready to go when Biden called on October 11 and pleaded with Netanyahu to consider the consequences of the action. Israel officials saw the strike as a preemptive attack against the Lebanese group, which they feared would attack Israel in the footsteps of Hamas.<br><br>

                Since then, the U.S. has been actively working to de-escalate the conflict, including positioning military assets in the eastern Mediterranean and engaging in diplomatic efforts. Still, Biden has yet to call for a ceasefire.<br><br>

                Since October 7, Israel has killed over 20,000 Palestinians. Hamas media claims 8,000 children have been killed.

                Chinese scientists have engineered a new fiber that, when knitted into a sweater, offers as much warmth as a down jacket despite being one-fifth as thick.<br><br>

                The fiber mimics the thermal properties of polar bear fur, which keeps bears warm because its hairs have both a porous core and a dense shell. The scientists used a light, synthetic material known as aerogel to engineer the fiber, allowing it to maintain heat-trapping properties even after being stretched, washed, and dyed.<br><br>

                Tests in -20°C (-4°F) conditions showed the fiber sweater offered superior thermal protection compared to down, wool, or cotton equivalents.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Researchers at Johns Hopkins have figured out that surgeons can learn skills in virtual reality and transfer them to real life—so long as they are zapped in the head with gentle, non-invasive electrical stimulation.<br><br>

                Nowadays, surgeons are likely to learn certain skills in a virtual reality environment. One of the challenges with this new technology, however, is carrying the skills from a virtual environment to real life.<br><br>

                In a study with 36 participants, those receiving the electrical stimulation demonstrated significantly better skill transfer from virtual to real environments, especially for complex and quick tasks. Scientists say this happens because stimulation depolarizes the neurons, which means neurons can communicate with each other better, facilitating the flow of information within the brain.<br><br>

                The potential of this technology extends beyond surgical training, possibly revolutionizing skill learning in various industries and reducing training time and costs.<br><br>

                Guido Caccianiga, the study’s lead author: “The group that didn’t receive stimulation struggled a bit more to apply the skills they learned in virtual reality to the actual robot, especially the most complex moves involving quick motions. The groups that received brain stimulation were better at those tasks.”

                As temperatures rise around the world, some species have been observed to have become more nocturnal to avoid the midday heat, raising concerns about potential impacts on the food chain.<br><br>

                For instance, researchers have observed that white-lipped peccaries in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, typically active during the day, have shifted their activity to cooler mornings and eventually after sunset as temperatures rose above 94 degrees Fahrenheit.<br><br>

                Similar behavioral changes have been observed in other species, like giant anteaters and cheetahs, indicating a broader trend of nocturnal adaptation among animals.<br><br>

                Scientists warn that while night activity helps avoid the heat, it exposes animals to new risks, like increased predation and difficulties in food finding. Still, some scientists are optimistic, hoping that these animals can adapt to climate change.<br><br>

                Sasha Kaletsky, co-founder and managing partner at Creator Ventures, said at a forum in Abu Dhabi: “People are posting a lot less on public social media.

                A new tech startup called Prophetic aims to bring lucid dreams to a wide audience by developing a wearable device to spark the experience when desired.<br><br>

                Lucid dreams occur when a person essentially wakes up in their own dream and is aware enough to control parts of the dream. These dreams have been found to help with PTSD, reduce anxiety, and improve mood, confidence, motor skills, and creativity—yet half of adults say they have only experienced them once in their lifetime.<br><br>

                This envisioned technology would work by detecting “when dreamers are in REM to induce and stabilize lucid dreams” with a device called Halo slated for a 2025 release.<br><br>

                To research this project, Prophetic has partnered with a university in the Netherlands to generate the largest dataset of electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations of lucid dreamers.<br><br>

                Nico Adelhofer, researcher: “Ideally, the user would not notice the device at all, but would see effects only in slight changes in dream experiences that appear natural and non-artificial. An insight moment might be triggered, leading to a questioning of the current dream reality by the dreamer, and consequently to a lucid dream, which, when combined with full perceptual immersion, is easily one of the most curious and exhilarating experiences for humans to have.”

                One representative from each state is working on the legislation, fighting against what they call the Democrats’ “lawfare” to attack Trump.<br><br>

                The lawmakers told Breitbart: “We are joining forces to introduce legislation to REMOVE Joe Biden from the ballot in Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. The absurdity of radical Democrat judges removing Donald Trump from the ballot in Colorado will be a stain on the American political system for decades. By their very own interpretation of the law, Joe Biden is 100% not eligible to run for political office.”<br><br>

                “Democrats’ insane justification to remove Trump can just as easily be applied to Joe Biden for his ‘insurrection’ at the southern border and his alleged corrupt family business dealings with China,” they added.<br><br>

                The Colorado Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Trump is ineligible to run for president because he incited “insurrection” on January 6, 2021, thus prohibiting him from appearing on the state ballot. Unlike Colorado, Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania are swing states, meaning a removal of either candidate from the ballot would be a massive upset.

                A new study links green neighborhoods to slower cellular aging.<br><br>

                The study, published in Science of the Total Environment, found longer telomeres in residents of greener areas. Telomeres are protective structures on chromosome ends, like plastic caps on shoelaces keeping DNA from unraveling, and indicate longer life and slower aging when elongated.<br><br>

                The study analyzed medical records and survey responses of over 7,800 people, connecting this data with census information on neighborhood green space. The results showed a 5% increase in green space is correlated with a 1% reduction in cell aging.<br><br>

                Researchers noted that participants who lived in green neighborhoods that were also plagued by pollution and segregation did not have longer telomeres than similar communities with less greenery.<br><br>

                Aaron Hipp, a professor of parks at North Carolina State and a co-author of the study: “Research is now showing that where we live, what we are exposed to, how much we exercise, what we eat, each of these can impact the speed of telomeres degrading and again our aging process. A longer telomere is usually a younger telomere, or a more protective, helpful telomere. It is protecting that cell from the aging process. The more green the area, the slower the cell aging.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Trump slammed a new poll that shows Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley trailing him by just 4% in the New Hampshire primary.<br><br>

                Trump, on Truth Social: “Fake New Hampshire poll was released on Birdbrain. Just another scam!”<br><br>

                The poll, conducted this month by American Research Group Inc., asked voters in New Hampshire who their preference was in the Republican presidential primary. Trump earned 33% and Haley scored 29%, surprising many political analysts.<br><br>

                New Hampshire has the first primary in the election season, with its results providing an early sign of who may clasp the nomination. In 2016, Trump won the primary, stunning Republicans and Democrats alike.<br><br>

                Haley has been increasingly established as the leading anti-Trump candidate in the Republican Party, receiving an endorsement from the Koch Network, a prominent Republican group that is vocally opposed to MAGA. She’s also drawing fanfare from Wall Street, with reports that hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin is “actively contemplating” supporting her after she reportedly met with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                New research indicates that 39% of U.S. employees working at a job for less than six months plan to leave within a year, a 6% increase from 2022.<br><br>

                Possible reasons include unmet expectations and a lack of flexibility, especially when it comes to working in the office. COVID has normalized remote work, and now even many top executives look down on returning to the office.<br><br>

                For instance, a Deloitte survey from August found that 66% of executives who worked remotely at least part of the week said they would quit if they were required to come back to the office full-time. Over half of executives say they're feeling pressured to go into the office more often.<br><br>

                There’s also a trend of “boomeranging” emerging, where employees are returning to former employers for better familiarity and possibly enhanced positions and compensation. Employers are now increasingly focusing on alumni as potential rehires.

                Danish architecture studio BIG has unveiled “Mindfulness City,” a 620-square-mile development in Bhutan, featuring an international airport and hydroelectric dam-temple.<br><br>

                Located in Gelephu, the city will be a “land of bridges,” integrating 35 rivers and streams into its design, connecting nature, culture, and innovation. The development boasts “inhabitable bridges” doubling as cultural landmarks and infrastructure, housing a university, healthcare center, market, and spiritual center.<br><br>

                The city will also include a hydroelectric dam, described as “a man-made cliff,” that will incorporate a temple. The buildings within the masterplan will be built from local materials like wood, stone, and bamboo.<br><br>

                Bjarke Ingels, designer: “Shaped by waterways, Gelephu becomes a land of bridges, connecting nature and people, past and future, local and global. Like the traditional Dzongs, these inhabitable bridges turn into cultural landmarks, doubling as transportation infrastructure combined with civic facilities. The Gelephu masterplan gives form to His Majesty's vision to create a city that becomes a cradle for growth and innovation while remaining founded on Bhutanese nature and culture.”

                Barbara Rotunda and Jean Torell-McDonald: “Our organization reaches out to nursing home facilities, compiles a list of individuals in need at each facility, shops for personalized gifts, elegantly wraps them with their signature bow, and ensures timely delivery so that residents can enjoy Christmas presents.”

                A woman linked to Jeffrey Epstein is asking the judge overseeing the release of Epstein’s client list to not release her name, saying she fears for safety in her “culturally conservative country.”<br><br>

                It’s unclear what relationship the woman, known as “Doe 107,” has with Epstein, but her attorney wrote to the judge that she “faces risks of physical harm” if her name is released. She has requested 30 extra days to provide evidence supporting her fears.<br><br>

                The request comes just days after Judge Loretta Preska ordered the release of court documents naming 177 associates of Jeffrey Epstein, set for early January 2024. The documents are part of a defamation case brought by Prince Andrew’s accuser Virginia Roberts against Epstein's madam Ghislaine Maxwell.<br><br>

                Names to be released include Epstein's friends, recruiters, victims, and employees, like housekeepers from his private island. Material likely includes depositions, emails, and legal documents, with some linking to high-profile figures like Prince Andrew.

                The proportion of young male college students has dropped from 47% to 44%, especially in four-year universities where they now make up only 42%.<br><br>

                Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has suggested removing Biden from the Texas ballot over his handling of immigration, inspired by Colorado's action against Trump.<br><br>

                On Tuesday, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is ineligible to run for president because he incited “insurrection” on January 6, 2021. As a result, he has been banned from the state’s ballot, barring an overruling from the Supreme Court.<br><br>

                Patrick said in an interview with Fox News: “Seeing what happened in Colorado tonight … makes me think — except we believe in democracy in Texas — maybe we should take Joe Biden off the ballot in Texas for allowing eight million people to cross the border since he’s been president, disrupting our state far more than anything anyone else has done in recent history.”<br><br>

                It’s unclear what the connection is between immigration and “insurrection,” but Patrick’s comments are emblematic of the polarization in America that the Colorado decision has only intensified. For instance, “Civil War” trended on X following the decision.

                For the first time since the 1940s, nearly half of U.S. young adults are living at home, with some parents delaying retirement and depleting savings to provide for their adult children.<br><br>

                Economic uncertainty, massive student debt, and the lack of affordable housing are driving the trend. Even young adults not living at home are receiving help, with millions having their parents help fund rent, bills, and everyday costs.<br><br>

                U.S. parents are now spending about $500 billion every year on their 18- to 34-year-old children, which is double what they put toward retirement.<br><br>

                Parents are supporting their adult children in the following ways: regular allowance (23%), rent (23%), bills (49%), and expenses for their child to live at home (64%).<br><br>

                The "tradwife" trend promotes traditional domestic roles for women, emphasizing homemaking over careers, and has garnered over 296.5 million views on TikTok.<br><br>

                The woman's husband became fixated on these videos, leading to a change in his behavior and expectations, including criticizing her appearance, work hours, and domestic contribution.<br><br>

                The conflict escalated as the husband began comparing his wife to other women, demanding she quit her job.<br><br>

                The final straw in the marriage was the husband's online communication with another woman, leading to a divorce.<br><br>

                The woman: “We were not a traditional couple. We both work, we both do chores and child care. He didn’t complain about it. Around March this year, he started acting weird, he complained about how I looked. He complained about the food. He complained about me working long hours. I work the same hours as he does. Throughout our marriage, he never had any complaints about the food I cook. I dress up in a more comfortable attire when I am in my house. He never had a problem with that ever.”<br><br>

                “I told him this was all an act that she puts up for the world to see. This is not reality. Plus nobody cleans their house wearing pretty dresses. The dresses will get dirty. I tried to tell him to stop watching this type of content. It really hurts me that he would idolize another woman rather than his wife,” she added.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A team from MIT has discovered a new class of antibiotics for the first time in 60 years using AI deep learning models.<br><br>

                The AI technology was used to predict the activity and toxicity of potential drug compounds against a methicillin-resistant bacterium that kills thousands around the world each year. It was trained with data from around 39,000 compounds, leading to the identification of two promising antibiotic candidates.<br><br>

                The researchers say this triumph could spark a turning point in the fight against antibiotic resistance, with more antibiotics to be discovered. Scientists have been warning for years that we may be entering a “post-antibiotic” era due to an over-dependence on drugs causing bacteria to evolve and become resistant over time.<br><br>

                Felix Wong, researcher: "What we set out to do in this study was to open the black box. These models consist of very large numbers of calculations that mimic neural connections, and no one really knows what's going on underneath the hood.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                In a historical first, Donald Trump has been prohibited from appearing on a state ballot, Colorado’s, in next year’s presidential primary election.<br><br>

                In a 4-3 ruling, the Colorado Supreme Court found that Trump is ineligible to be president under the Fourteenth Amendment, which disqualifies those who engage in “insurrection.”<br><br>

                Regarding the events on January 6, 2021, the Court wrote that Trump’s “direct and express efforts, over several months, exhorting his supporters to march to the Capitol to prevent what he falsely characterized as an alleged fraud on the people of this country were indisputably overt and voluntary.”<br><br>

                Importantly, the Court’s ruling will be put on hold until January 4, pending Trump’s appeal to the Supreme Court.<br><br>

                There are currently about three dozen cases across the country aiming to remove Trump from the ballot. The Colorado decision could serve as a precedent if the Supreme Court doesn’t overrule.<br><br>

                Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson: “Unsurprisingly, the all-Democrat appointed Colorado Supreme Court has ruled against President Trump, supporting a Soros-funded, left-wing group’s scheme to interfere in an election on behalf of Crooked Joe Biden by removing President Trump’s name from the ballot and eliminating the rights of Colorado voters to vote for the candidate of their choice. We have full confidence that the U.S. Supreme Court will quickly rule in our favor and finally put an end to these un-American lawsuits.”<br><br>

                Alina Habba, Trump's personal lawyer: “This ruling attacks the very heart of this nation’s democracy. It will not stand, and we trust that the Supreme Court will reverse this unconstitutional order.”

                Following the Colorado decision, “civil war” started trending on X, with Trump supporters seeing the development as another sign that American institutions are fundamentally at odds with them.<br><br>

                One user wrote on a post that already has 10,000 likes: “If Colorado bans Trump from the ballot and the US Supreme Court does not intervene, all states with Republican Supreme Courts must strike Biden from the ballot too. If they want to end democracy, we can do the same. They’re going to start a Civil War.”<br><br>

                Another user responded: “This could happen… it should happen. But I doubt the Republican Supreme Courts would have the balls.”<br><br>

                Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy announced he pledges to withdraw from the Colorado Republican primary ballot until Trump is allowed to be on the ballot, demanding “Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, and Nikki Haley do the same immediately - or else they are tacitly endorsing this illegal maneuver which will have disastrous consequences for our country.”<br><br>

                Ron DeSantis released a vague statement without naming Trump, assuredly following the advice of his consultants: “The Left invokes ‘democracy’ to justify its use of power, even if it means abusing judicial power to remove a candidate from the ballot based on spurious legal grounds.  SCOTUS should reverse.”<br><br>

                Even foreign leaders chimed in—El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele wrote, “The United States has lost its ability to lecture any other country about ‘democracy.’”

                Tokyo is pioneering advanced agriculture using private 5G, attracting global interest.<br><br>

                The project, led by NTT AgriTechnology, aims to address Japan's declining agricultural workforce and aging population. High-tech greenhouses equipped with private 5G, 4K cameras, and other technologies enable remote farming, even for inexperienced workers.<br><br>

                The environments in the greenhouses were managed fully automatically, with sensors that measured factors like the temperature and indoor CO2 concentration to optimize the photosynthesis of the crops.<br><br>

                Tokyo's innovative approach has drawn attention from worldwide agriculture professionals for its potential as a model for global agriculture challenges.<br><br>

                Nakanishi Masahiro, project manager, NTT East: “Workers with no farming experience were able to grow high-quality tomatoes with remote instruction. We've even had better yields from the second year onward, so results have been great.”<br><br>

                Other countries, such as the Netherlands and Spain, have also succeeded in using these technologies, with the former being the second-largest agricultural producing country in the world.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Retailers are pulling out of self-checkout or adding restrictions amid shoplifting and frustrated customers.<br><br>

                In 2021, self-checkout accounted for 30% of transactions, almost double from 2018. Now, however, the technology is facing a reckoning. Walmart has started removing self-checkout kiosks from locations; Target is limiting the number of items a shopper can purchase through a kiosk; and British supermarket chain Booths has been eliminating self-checkout for the past 18 months in response to customer backlash.<br><br>

                Cindy Whittington, 66: “Going to the grocery store used to be simple, and now it’s frustrating. You’re paying more. You’re working harder to pay for merchandise at their store. And it’s become an ordeal to check out. I should get a 5% discount.”<br><br>

                Stores face a dilemma: self-checkouts help them reduce labor costs, but they don’t want to lose customers. Additionally, the technology increases the likelihood of thefts, as shoppers do the scanning themselves and can easily sneak items out.<br><br>

                Others love the autonomy, however, such as Ellen Wulfhorst, 65: “There’s something childish and fun about it. I get a big kick out of sliding the product across the reader, and it goes beep. There’s a certain satisfaction to it.”

                The tech was allegedly used to identify and track suspected shoplifters. Rite Aid's use of facial recognition reportedly led to wrongful accusations, disproportionately affecting people of color.<br><br>

                The company is now being forced to delete all collected data and establish comprehensive customer safeguards.<br><br>

                Samuel Levine, FTC's director: “Rite Aid’s reckless use of facial surveillance systems left its customers facing humiliation and other harms, and its order violations put consumers’ sensitive information at risk. Today’s groundbreaking order makes clear that the Commission will be vigilant in protecting the public from unfair biometric surveillance and unfair data security practices.”

                The leaders of Guyana, which is poised to become one of the richest countries in the world per capita, have signed an agreement with the University of Miami’s School of Architecture to design a smart city from scratch.<br><br>

                The city, called Silica City, is envisioned as a model for the country’s future, featuring a residential area, a city center, and a research area called Innovation Village, which will be the hub of the city.<br><br>

                It will accommodate 60,000 residents and integrate biophilic design, sustainable features, and AI, as well as health and well-being services.<br><br>

                Sensors would be embedded throughout the different buildings and structures to facilitate the day-to-day operation of the city, as well as its maintenance. For example, they would monitor changes in traffic patterns so that traffic lights could adjust in real-time to weather events, congestion, and accidents.<br><br>

                The plan will also include telehealth and remote sensing components so that medical care can be provided to citizens in their homes.<br><br>

                This amount of lithium is enough to make batteries for 382 million electric vehicles.<br><br>

                Michael McKibben, a geochemistry professor at the University of California, Riverside: “This is one of the largest lithium brine deposits in the world. This could make the United States completely self-sufficient in lithium and stop importing it through China.”<br><br>

                The study, conducted at the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland, involved scientists showing apes photographs of former groupmates who had died or relocated. The time these apes hadn’t seen these friends ranged from nine months to 26 years.<br><br>

                Scientists left these pictures accessible to the apes and used an eye-tracking device to measure where they looked and for how long.<br><br>

                The conclusion: the apes looked “significantly longer” at those they knew, no matter how long it had been since they saw them, and even longer at those they had been friendly with.<br><br>

                One bonobo hadn’t seen sister Loretta or nephew Erin for 26 years but “showed a strikingly robust looking bias toward both of them over eight trials.”<br><br>

                Laura Lewis, biological anthropologist: “The idea that they do remember others and therefore they may miss these individuals is really a powerful cognitive mechanism and something that’s been thought of as uniquely human.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Rancho Cielo is a unique educational facility in Monterey County, California, that transforms the lives of at-risk youth.<br><br>

                Emphasizing hands-on learning and personal development, it offers courses in construction and sustainable design, auto and diesel repair, welding and fabrication, culinary academy, and agricultural technology.<br><br>

                Originally a rundown juvenile detention center, it was repurposed by Judge John Phillips into a supportive educational space.<br><br>

                The facility caters to students aged 16 to 24, offering various vocational programs and a supportive environment.<br><br>

                It boasts a success rate with 84.8% of its graduates, who have encountered the criminal justice system, not re-offending.<br><br>

                The school operates with a unique public-private funding model, enhancing its resource capacity.<br><br>

                Instead of the more than $110,000 a year it costs to incarcerate a juvenile in the county, Rancho Cielo requires $25,000 a year to run.<br><br>

                John Phillips, former judge: “I’m thinking, 'I’m sending kids to prison for life.’ It's very easy to pull a trigger if you don't have any future, you don't have any goals and you don't have anything to look forward to.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                25% of 40-year-olds in the U.S. have never been married, the highest since the data started being recorded in 1900, according to the Pew Research Center.<br><br>

                For perspective, in 1980, just 6% of people in this group were unmarried, steadily rising since then.<br><br>

                Additionally, 78% of these unmarried people live alone, with only 22% reporting they live with a partner.<br><br>

                These findings correspond with a poll from July that found 40% of young U.S. adults think marriage is an outdated tradition.<br><br>

                There are likely various reasons for this trend, such as women prioritizing a career, the ubiquity of birth control, and the rising costs of childcare and housing.

                Billy Garland, 2Pac's father, sees Duane “Keffe D” Davis, who was arrested in September for 2Pac's murder, as a "tool" used by higher powers.<br><br>

                Garland suggests that influential figures like 2Pac are targeted due to their potential to lead and inspire others.<br><br>

                Keffe D, arrested 27 years after 2Pac's death, has pleaded not guilty.<br><br>

                Garland: "He's always been a tool, and there's just time that they used him for what they wanted to use him. Because if you couldn't see if it was the government, the justice department, the LAPD, the Las Vegas Police Department, and several other entities... Anytime an African American man gets strong that has the potential to lead other people, he's not gonna survive."<br><br>

                "Let's be very honest, Keffe is not a very intelligent individual. When you go on air and say you participated in a high-scale assassination, eventually it's going to come back on you. I'm surprised he went that far that long without them arresting him. He was in the car. That's aiding and abetting in the murder. But he was doing his part, with the rest of the people who were talking about Orlando Anderson. He was fulfilling that glitch. He was adding to their truth, which we all know wasn't true."<br><br>

                "I don’t think we’ll ever find out who really did the shooting but we know it wasn’t no one individual."

            <p class="paragraphr">
                After growing a successful company and selling it to a conglomerate, Peter Doelger turned his focus to investing in stocks and oil.<br><br>

                By the age of 78, Doelger, who started showing signs of dementia, reached a staggering $50 million net worth.<br><br>

                At this point in his life, he chose JPMorgan to manage his immense fortune. Yet over the next half-decade, almost all of Peter’s wealth was wiped, his wife says, as the pair increasingly relied on JPMorgan’s advice for managing their portfolio.<br><br>

                Now, a legal claim in Boston federal court has been filed to examine if a major financial firm could be held responsible for wiping the investments of a client with dementia. The court case is being seen as shining a spotlight on an under-reported issue in Wall Street: boomers, many of whom face cognitive decline, placing their money in the hands of conglomerates.<br><br>

                Yoon, Peter’s wife: “We had 100% trust in them that they will manage our assets. We didn’t expect them to make us a fortune but at least make us comfortable.”<br><br>

                Peter, who’s now 86, is unable to remember many details, with a court declaring him unable to testify in the litigation.<br><br>

                JPMorgan says Peter was fully aware of the actions being taken and that he showed no signs of cognitive decline.

                A new poll of 2,000 STEM workers found that 75% say other nations have topped or will soon surpass the U.S. in science and technology.<br><br>

                Just 8% of respondents said the U.S. is the global leader in science and tech and is expanding its lead.<br><br>

                In addition, 60% believe that China will be the global leader in science and technology in 5 years.<br><br>

                The startup LambdaVision is engineering the world's first protein-based artificial retina for a genetic cause of blindness.<br><br>

                The manufacturing process involves creating 200 even layers of light-sensitive protein in a polymer mesh.<br><br>

                These layers must be perfectly even for the retina to work properly, a process that’s hard to get right on Earth.<br><br>

                Thus, in late 2018, the company turned to the International Space Station in the hopes that the microgravity there could help. In the eight experiments it has sent to the Space Station so far, the production quality has improved dramatically, reducing waste and achieving more uniform layers.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Two Japanese towns are successfully boosting their populations as the national birth rate hits a historical low.<br><br>

                With a population of over 300,000, Akashi offers free baby food, nappies, medical care, and school lunches to support families. These efforts seem to be paying off, as the town’s population has increased for ten years in a row.<br><br>

                In Nagareyama, the population has grown by 24% to 211,000, thanks to child-friendly policies like a bus service for daycare and increased nurseries.<br><br>

                “Our aim was to create an environment in which parents can continue to work while raising children,” says Izaki Yoshiharu, the town’s mayor.<br><br>

                Nationwide, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stated it’s “now or never” to address the country’s falling birthrate, warning in January that its infrastructure was “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.”<br><br>

                He pledged to double the government’s spending on child-related programs and establish a government agency to solely focus on the issue.<br><br>

                Japan has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, with fewer than 800,000 births being recorded last year for the first time since records began in 1899.<br><br>

                Just one day after Ye invoked Adolf Hitler’s name during a sermon in Las Vegas, media outlets are claiming Trump echoed a phrase straight from the German leader’s “Mein Kampf” during a rally in New Hampshire.<br><br>

                Trump said that migrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and that illegal immigrants have “poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world.”<br><br>

                In his 1925 manifesto, Hitler wrote: “All great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning.”<br><br>

                The media has routinely compared the two leaders, going so far as to say Trump’s use of the word “vermin” in November was reminiscent of the Nazis. As this continues, many wonder if Trump may view the comparisons fondly and start quoting from Adi directly.

                Amanda Sanders, a personal stylist who buys gifts for her clients’ children: “These younger kids have the taste level of a 40-year-old woman, at least in Manhattan. The age of asking for a toy stops at seven or eight. They’re into makeup. They’re into jewelry — not Disney, real jewelry. It’s all about labels, labels, labels. I’ve seen kids wear Balenciaga.”<br><br>

                She added: “I’ve heard kids asking for Prada and Marc Jacobs bags. They’re also asking for the Louis Vuitton card holder, they put their ID in. Some of the kids like Burberry. A lot of the kids like a Gucci belt, Gucci wallet on a chain.”<br><br>

                Some parents complain their children are seeing what’s trendy on TikTok and then ask Santa for it.<br><br>

                One parent recalled: “A mini fridge!? I said, ‘This isn’t the Bellagio.’ I don’t think they necessarily need to have high-end skincare.”<br><br>

                Unfortunately, these children often have to settle for what they can get—one daughter asked for $150 Ugg boots, and her parents only got her a meager $100 puffer jacket instead.

                YEWS has been blacklisted by Instagram, barely two days after a debut greeted with universal acclaim. Curated by Ye, and provided free to the public, YEWS distills domestic and international headlines into three simple, sane, and serene memos per day.<br><br>

                As of this afternoon, the Instagram platform aggressively checks for links to YEWS, and disables posting, sharing and liking features whenever one is found. This has the effect of suspending a user’s account until the offending URL has been deleted.<br><br>

                On reflection, we are grateful to Mark Zuckerberg and Meta for this unintentional accolade. Because global, domain-wide link bans are the highest compliment Silicon Valley can bestow upon a news organization.

            <h3 class="hecho">Worse Than Jan 6: Butt Sex in Senate</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                A video showing two men performing an ungodly act in the Senate hearing room, where Senators ask Supreme Court nominees questions, has been leaked.<br><br>

                One of the men is unknown while the other has been identified as a staffer for Democrat Senator Ben Cardin.<br><br>

                The video was reportedly shared in a group chat and was subsequently leaked from there.<br><br>

                The staffer, Aiden Maese-Czeropski, made the news earlier this week for yelling “Free Palestine” at a Jewish congressman, making some wonder if the leak was an act of retaliation.<br><br>

                In a LinkedIn post today, Maese-Czeropski wrote: “This has been a difficult time for me, as I have been attacked for who I love to pursue a political agenda. While some of my actions in the past have shown poor judgment, I love my job and would never disrespect my workplace.”<br><br>

                Some online commentators have suggested Maese-Czeropski should receive a similar punishment as the January 6 defendants for disrespecting a sacred temple of democracy, while others note he’s just a scapegoat, as this kind of behavior is the norm in our nation’s capital.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Ariana Grande is locked in a contract with celebrity manager Scooter Braun despite wishing to cut all ties with him, sources say.<br><br>

                Reports emerged earlier this year that the singer had signed with Brandon Creed and dropped all ties with Braun—whose significant other has been “ran like Olympics,” according to “Vultures”—but insiders say Grande is still “contractually obligated.”<br><br>

                Sources: “Although Ariana has indeed found new music management, she has not dropped or cut ties with Scooter because she is tied in contractually. She continues to be contractually bound to Scooter as there are several long-term contracts still in place. If Ariana were to release a new album tomorrow, she would still be obligated to pay Scooter in addition to Brandon. Nothing has changed there.”<br><br>

                They added that Ariana is refusing to work with Scooter, with “legal proceedings pending.”<br><br>

                She’s not the first celebrity to want to leave Braun: Demi Lovato split with Scooter in August after four years together, with rumors that Justin Bieber wants to leave as well.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Prince Harry was the victim of “extensive” phone hacking by Mirror Group Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail, the High Court in Britain ruled today.<br><br>

                The judge found that at least fifteen news articles relied on illegal information-gathering methods such as hacking voicemail messages and private investigators. Prince Harry claimed this went on for fifteen years.<br><br>

                Additionally, the judge ruled that “there can be no doubt” that Piers Morgan, who was the editor of the Daily Mail during this time, knew this was happening.<br><br>

                In response, Morgan said: “I've never hacked a phone or told anyone else to hack a phone,” adding that “Prince Harry's outrage at media intrusion into the private lives of the royal family is only matched by his own hypocritical enthusiasm for doing it himself,” and that he “wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him round his California tanned faced.”<br><br>

                Prince Harry was awarded about $180,000 in damages.<br><br>

                Following the ruling, the Duke of Sussex said: “Today’s ruling is vindicating and affirming. I’ve been told that slaying dragons will get you burned. But in light of today’s victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press – it’s a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.”

                Migrants are saying the meals served at New York City asylum-seeking shelters are so “bad” that they throw them away, wasting 70,000 taxpayer-funded meals, or $776,000, in one month.<br><br>

                Jesus Alberto, from Venezuela, notes that “no one likes the food,” emphasizing, “Without lying, it’s bad, bad.”<br><br>

                Johana Roa, a mother, rips the pancakes, donuts, and cookies given for breakfast: “The breakfast they give us is very sweet. They give us pancakes, donuts, and cookies for breakfast at 6AM. It is too sweet to give to my daughter, so I just take a few things.”<br><br>

                “Nothing healthy apart from eggs and fruit, apples and oranges. No oats,” she adds.<br><br>

                As a result, these migrants purchase food from private enterprises, usually in enclaves that align with their heritage, making them wonder why they even came to America in the first place if they can’t receive benefits funded by taxpayers.<br><br>

                City Hall spokesperson: “As we continue to adjust food orders to improve quality, quantity, and respond to cultural preferences, we are dedicated to providing those in our care with enough food, while at the same time being responsible stewards of public resources.”

                The first death was a 21-year-old female college student, whose family filed a lawsuit against the company, calling the lemonade a “dangerous energy drink.”<br><br>

                One large Charged Lemonade contains 390 milligrams of caffeine, more caffeine than Monster and Red Bull combined.<br><br>

                For reference, FDA guidelines suggest a maximum of 400 milligrams of caffeine in a day for healthy adults.<br><br>

                Panera has since installed warning signs about the caffeine content, advising moderation and caution for sensitive groups.

                Metro Boomin was awarded the key to the City of St. Louis on Thursday in gratitude for his seven-year “Single Moms Are Superheroes” campaign, an annual event that helps single mothers navigate life.<br><br>

                This year, his charity partnered with Amazon Access and Rung for Women to help single mothers with skills training and career coaching.<br><br>

                Metro has announced the event will also be renamed to Leslie Joanne Single Mothers And Caregivers Appreciation Day to honor his mother who passed away in 2022.<br><br>

                Mayor Tishaura Jones: “Today I awarded a Key to the City to St. Louis’ own Metro Boomin, not only to recognize his incredible work as a producer in the music industry, but also his tireless advocacy for single mothers and domestic abuse victims. Metro has made St. Louis proud at only 30 years old, and I can’t wait to see what else he will accomplish to keep putting St. Louis on the map.”<br><br>

                In a speech, Metro said: “This is only the beginning of all the great things that I want to do for the city to help turn things around one household at a time. As far as today, the day is officially Leslie Joanne Day after my mother, and not after myself.”<br><br>

                December 14 in St. Louis will now be known as “Leland Metro Boomin Wayne Day.”

                The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the largest children’s charity in the UK, has been leading an effort since 2017 for stronger online safety regulations. The charity claims that since that year, police forces have recorded 34,400 online grooming crimes against children.<br><br>

                According to the complaint, the mayor of Harvey, Illinois, knew the strip club sponsored prostitution and demanded a bribe to keep the club open.<br><br>

                The club went along with the demand, even doubling its payment to $6,000 a month at one point. This went on for 15 years.<br><br>

                During this exchange, “pizza” was used as a codeword for the payments, with the mayor telling the club manager to “deliver pizzas.”<br><br>

                In 2017, the club was searched by law enforcement based on evidence of prostitution and tax crimes, with the manager later agreeing to work with investigators.<br><br>

                Brian Ditore claimed the chocolate bar's name was “confusingly similar and phonetically equivalent” to his “Dee’s Nuts” gourmet peanut company.<br><br>

                Ditore said his company was named after his grandmother as a way to pay homage to “her comedic flair,” securing the trademark in 2012.<br><br>

                Mr. Beast’s lawyers: “Millions of people on the internet have come to use the phrase ‘deez nuts’ as an irreverent way to interject humor or sarcasm into or end a conversation. In fact, ‘deez nutz’ ultimately landed in the Urban Dictionary and is defined as a euphemism and slang term.”<br><br>

                Mr Beast’s legal team claimed the “deez nutz” phrase comes from Dr. Dre’s 1992 album “The Chronic,” but a U.S. District Court judge wasn’t convinced and ruled in favor of Ditore.

                To the people in South Africa, the tree also has enormous spiritual value—in ancient times, leaders would hold governmental meetings under the tree, believing the spirit of the tree would provide them with wisdom.

                Expected to be operational in April of next year, DeepSouth’s revelations into the human brain would aid researchers in engineering AI that match the human brain’s intelligence and operations.<br><br>

                Ralph Etienne-Cummings, computer engineering professor: “At the end of the day there’s two types of researchers who will be interested in this — either those studying neuroscience or those who want to prototype new engineering solutions in the AI space.”

                Twitch, once a platform to make money from live-streaming games, is now appeasing its growing female user base by allowing for “artistic” nudity.<br><br>

                Specifically, content that “deliberately highlights breasts, buttocks or pelvic region,” is now allowed.<br><br>

                That’s not all—certain dances like “twerking, grinding, and pole dancing” are approved now.<br><br>

                Critics say Twitch is collapsing into a full-fledged porn site, questioning what incentives, if any, men have to become painstakingly good at a game if women can just show their tits and make bank.

                Australia has become the first country to ban engineered stone, a material largely used for kitchen benches and bathrooms.<br><br>

                Effective July 2024, The decision follows a significant rise in silicosis cases among hundreds of workers handling the material largely used for kitchen benches and bathrooms.<br><br>

                Dr. Ryan Hoy, respiratory physician: “Some of these people with silicosis, they're extremely sick… we have a condition which caused them to become so short of breath it's hard to do just normal daily activities. We really need to change the ways to identify problems at work, and act before people become sick.”<br><br>

                Liam O'Brien, assistant secretary of the Council of Trade Unions: "Engineered stone is a fashion product that is killing the workers who make it. With alternatives readily available, why are we risking the lives of tradies for a fashionable finish in our kitchens?"<br><br>

                Caesarstone, a large engineered stone manufacturer, said it was “deeply disappointed” by the decision: “Most importantly, the decision fails to address the real cause of rising silicosis rates - poor compliance with and enforcement of safety standards.”

                The boycotts were spurred by claims that major corporations like Disney and Walmart were advertising next to “antisemitic” content.<br><br>

                In response, Elon Musk filed a “thermonuclear” lawsuit against the company behind the claims: a progressive watchdog organization called Media Matters.<br><br>

                Musk has said his ultimate goal is to reduce reliance on advertising by moving to subscriptions, such as X Premium.<br><br>

                For now, advertisers hold the power—creators are voicing concerns that the boycotts have hindered their ability to profit on the platform, to which Musk responded that there’s “not much we can do if advertisers boycott or reduce spend on our platform.”

                Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott has apologized after reports emerged that he cited the 9/11 terrorist attacks as an example of excellent teamwork during a speech to players.<br><br>

                He pointed out that the 9/11 hijackers were all “on the same page” to orchestrate a terrorist attack to perfection.<br><br>

                The comments were made during a team meeting 4 years ago but were not reported until now.<br><br>

                McDermott asked the players with a straight face, “What tactics do you think they used to come together?” A young player tried to methodically answer. “What do you think their biggest obstacle was?” A veteran answered “TSA,” which lightened the mood.<br><br>

                Speaking to reporters, McDermott apologized: “My intent in that meeting that day was to discuss the importance of communication and being on the same page with the team. I regretted mentioning 9/11 in my message that day, and I immediately apologized to the team.”<br><br>

                He made sure to clarify that “not only was 9/11 a horrific event in our country’s history, but a day that I lost a good family friend.”

                Channel 1, set to launch next year, plans to use digitally generated people and digital doubles of real actors who had their bodies scanned.<br><br>

                Demonstration videos show anchors that talk, look, and move like real humans, but were designed on computers using AI technology.<br><br>

                The channel plans to stream its news on TV apps and is set to add a translation feature to roll it out globally.<br><br>

                Adam Mosam, the outlet's founder, told The Daily Mail that misuse of AI-generated news is inevitable, but Channel 1 aims to “get out in front of this and create a responsible use of the technology.”<br><br>

                For the more important stories, actual human anchors will report from the scene, Mosam clarified.<br><br>

                Additionally, for situations where original footage is unavailable, such as a news story about dinosaurs, AI-generated video will be shown onscreen and labeled as such.<br><br>

                An NYU dropout has raised $19 million to build a futuristic Mediterranean city that is based on “traditional Western beauty standards.”<br><br>

                Dryden Brown, 27, says the city, called Praxis, will be aimed at tech company founders, and that there are already 12,000 people interested.<br><br>

                One of the city’s founding documents celebrates “traditional, European/Western beauty standards on which the civilized world, at its best points, has always found success,” according to The New York Times.<br><br>

                Brown envisions the city centering around a “walkable urban maze woven together at the heart of the city - encouraging chance encounters and the delight of uncharted discovery.”<br><br>

                Additionally, he plans for the city to be populated by three “persona groups”: muscular warriors to protect from threats; “very thin” priests who define the values; and merchants who bring in capitalists and professionals.<br><br>

                In 2021, Praxis went through the first of two funding rounds, raising $4.2 million from investors including Pronomos Capital, backed by Peter Thiel.<br><br>

                In their second funding round, they received investment from Paradigm, a venture capital firm known for its $125 million stake in Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX.<br><br>

                Scientists have engineered the first-ever mind reader using a headwear device that scans your brainwaves and translates them into readable text through AI.<br><br>

                The invention was pioneered by a team at the University of Technology Sydney, with a translation accuracy score of about 40%.<br><br>

                This tech could allow patients who have become mute due to a stroke or paralysis to communicate with loved ones.<br><br>

                For example, one participant was asked to think: “Good afternoon! I hope you're doing well. I'll start with a cappuccino, please, with an extra shot of espresso.”<br><br>

                A screen then showed the AI’s response: “Afternoon! You well? Cappuccino, Xtra shot. Espresso.”<br><br>

                Lead researcher CT Lin: “This research represents a pioneering effort in translating raw EEG waves directly into language, marking a significant breakthrough in the field. It is the first to incorporate discrete encoding techniques in the brain-to-text translation process, introducing an innovative approach to neural decoding. The integration with large language models is also opening new frontiers in neuroscience and AI.”

                “Although pharmacies are legally permitted to tell their customers about government demands for their data, most don’t. As a result, many Americans’ prescription records have few meaningful privacy protections, and those protections vary widely depending on which pharmacy they use.”

                He added that subscribers can expect “a lot more” of what he’s been posting on X, mainly interviews with various political, media, and otherwise interesting figures.<br><br>

                Currently, the website has 3 new videos, including Carlson interviewing Dana White and Kid Rock.<br><br>

                The cost of a subscription right now is $9 a month or $72 annually.

            <h3 class="hecho">Study: Science Is Losing Creativity</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                A series of new studies have indicated that science is becoming less disruptive and more derivative, and one study ties that trend to collaboration becoming international and remote.<br><br>

                The study finds that “scientists in on-site teams are better placed to fuse knowledge and conceive the next breakthrough idea,” and that the possibility of disruptive research moves in the opposite direction as collaboration becomes more long-distance.<br><br>

                To determine whether research is disruptive, researchers looked at how often research is cited by future research: for instance, the ground-breaking study on the structure of DNA in 1953 is among the top 1% of disruptive research. <br><br>

                The researchers argue that “the post-pandemic shift towards remote work will probably favor incremental innovation at the expense of disruptive discoveries,” and that as a result, especially demanding tasks should be assigned to local teams to maximize impact.<br><br>

                Above all, this study emphasizes an effect of globalism that is rarely discussed and has implications for our progress as humanity.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Users on social media are celebrating the archeological feat of the world’s oldest condom and dildo being found completely intact.<br><br>

                The condom, dating back to 1640, was accompanied by a manual written in Latin that recommended the user dip it in warm milk to avoid diseases when sleeping with prostitutes.<br><br>

                It was part of an exhibit dedicated to The Cultural History of Sex at an Austrian museum in 2006.<br><br>

                Scientists have also recovered cavewoman dildos during a cave excavation in Germany, believed to be the oldest sex toys at 28,000 years old.<br><br>

                The dildos ranged in size and width, ensuring cavewomen had a wide variety of options.<br><br>

                One user commented: “I know them things was funky af.”

            <h3 class="hecho">Poll: 20% Of Gen Z Denies Holocaust</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                A new poll from The Economist found that 20% of 18- to 29-year-olds believe the Holocaust is a myth, and 30% are unsure.<br><br>

                Additionally, nearly a quarter of young people aged 18 to 29 agree that “the Holocaust has been exaggerated.”<br><br>

                Respondents in this age group were 5 times more likely than those over the age of 65 to say Jews wield too much power in America (28% versus 6%).<br><br>

                The Economist pointed to TikTok as a reason, and they’re not the only ones who have done so—Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has claimed that for every 30 minutes a kid watches TikTok, they miraculously become 17% more “antisemitic.”<br><br>

                The Economist: “Whatever the reasons, the polling is alarming.”

            <h3 class="hecho">Wall Street Has Bullish Hope for 2024</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Most analysts on Wall Street expect the S&P 500 in 2024 to either outperform or deliver in line with expectations, according to a new Bloomberg survey.<br><br>

                Additionally, more than two-thirds said they don’t see a hard economic landing as a top risk, with a majority expecting the Fed to cut rates before July.<br><br>

                This is a profound contrast from the expectations heading into 2023 when Wall Street feared the Fed would hike rates and volatile markets would be spurred by fears of a recession.<br><br>

                Heading into 2024, only 26% of the survey’s respondents think U.S. stocks will lag.<br><br>

                Moreover, strategists at banks like RBC Capital Markets and Deutsche Bank AG anticipate an all-time high for stocks.<br><br>

                Aneeka Gupta, macroeconomic research director at WisdomTree: “U.S. exceptionalism remains firmly in place. The key drivers are a more favorable economic backdrop versus China and Europe, improving earnings estimates, and cheaper valuations for the equal-weighted S&P 500.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                As Trump hopes to return to the White House in 2024, reports have emerged that his son-in-law Jared Kushner will be appointed to pick White House and Cabinet staff.<br><br>

                Additionally, Axios reports that Kushner may go so far as to be considered for secretary of state, citing sources close to Trump.<br><br>

                Many Trump supporters view Kushner as weak and fundamentally at odds with the America First agenda, evidenced by his support for policies like amnesty and a strong loyalty to Israel.<br><br>

                Trump seemed to find some credence in this criticism, saying during a White House meeting that Kushner was “more loyal to Israel than the U.S.,” according to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's book “Peril.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                To design buildings in sustainable ways, architects in the United Arab Emirates have turned to an unlikely source of inspiration: ancient construction techniques that were utilized before air conditioning existed.<br><br>

                Combined with the world’s newest technology, these methods combat heat without worsening climate change.<br><br>

                The techniques include minimizing the use of glass, integrating Islamic architecture to produce shade, situating buildings away from the sun, and studying wind patterns to maximize natural ventilation, according to architects who spoke with The New York Times.<br><br>

                In Dubai’s International Financial Center, the efforts of this new effort can already be seen: shaded spaces and narrow alleyways envelop the area, with the Grand Mosque incorporating perforated panels to emulate screens used in Egypt for centuries to block sunlight.
