            <p class="paragraphr">
                70% of U.S. adults consider themselves spiritual in some way, a new Pew Research study reveals.<br><br>

            The study distinguishes between being spiritual and religious, noting that 22% of U.S. adults identify as “spiritual but not religious.” Nearly 50% say they are both religious and spiritual, while 21% say they are neither spiritual nor religious.  10% say they are religious but not spiritual.<br><br>

            The study found a broad range of interpretations of “spiritual,” including being connected with nature, being connected with other people, being connected to loved ones who've died, being open-minded, or simply continuing family traditions.<br><br>

            Above all, the study shows there’s a yearning among Americans for something greater than themselves, providing meaning, purpose, and comfort in their lives.

            <h3 class="hecho">Stocks End 2023 With Surge</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Despite consumer confidence falling throughout 2023, the year saw a significant rise in the stock market, with the S&P 500 growing by 24.2% and the Nasdaq composite index jumping an impressive 43.4%.<br><br>

                The Russell 2000, an index of small cap stocks that tends to mirror sentiment about the U.S. domestic economy, rose 15.1%.<br><br>

                The total value of all stocks in the S&P 500 increased by about $8 trillion.<br><br>

                This growth occurred amid high inflation rates and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed, defying the recession many experts anticipated. The U.S. economy not only avoided the expected downturn but also saw rapid growth and low unemployment, with inflation rates falling quickly, suggesting a “soft landing.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Pakistan has issued a “strict ban” on all New Year’s Eve celebrations to “show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”<br><br>

                Anwaarul Haq Kakar, Pakistan’s caretaker prime minister: “The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.”<br><br>

                Authorities in Sharjah, the third largest emirate in the UAE, have similarly canceled customary NYE celebrations, including all firework displays, in solidarity with Gaza. Police announced last Wednesday that legal measures will be taken against people taking part in celebrations.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The biggest stars on OnlyFans are in such high demand that they have started paying men in third-world countries to pretend to be them and talk to their subscribers.<br><br>

                For instance, a 22-year-old named Juan in the Philippines spends 6 hours a day sending personalized, sexual chats to subscribers of an OnlyFans model who pays him.<br><br>

                Workers like Juan, known as chatters, all have to demonstrate proficiency in telling lewd stories as if they are the model. They charge an hourly rate plus a commission on each unit of content they sell, which can be as high as 15%.<br><br>

                On a perfect day, a model makes between $1,000 and $3,500 and the chatter earns $500.<br><br>

                The hiring process is intricate, notes Juan: “In the first weeks, a manager monitors your screen to evaluate your English, your speed and your naturalness when speaking. You have to know how to portray the model, speak like them, and know their background.”<br><br>

                Juan’s sister-in-law recommended him the job, and his girlfriend has the same job.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                China’s version of Twitter/X is actively suppressing online discussions about the country’s poverty rate, Western media has noticed.<br><br>

                On the Chinese app Weibo, a hashtag pointed to China’s dire economic situation by stating “964 million people” were surviving on just 2,000 Chinese yuan, or $280, a month.<br><br>

                The hashtag briefly reached the #1 trending spot on the app before it was taken down. Now, searches on the app for the hashtag return a message that reads: “In accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies, the content of this topic cannot be displayed.”<br><br>

                This isn’t the first time the app with 600 million monthly users has censored information about the economy—earlier this month, users who were vocal about China’s inequality received private messages instructing them “not to badmouth the economy.”

            <h3 class="hecho">Study: Newborns Recognize Beats</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                New research from Amsterdam finds that newborn babies have a natural affinity for the beats in music thanks to a cognitive mechanism already active at birth. Even babies of just a few days old are able to detect a regular pulse in music.<br><br>

                Researchers discovered this by measuring brain waves in infants who heard a drum rhythm through headphones. The wave responses showed that the babies heard the beat when the time interval between the beats was always the same.<br><br>

                These findings demonstrate “that being able to hear the beat is innate and not simply the result of learned sound sequences,” researcher István Winkler concluded.<br><br>

                He added: “Our findings suggest that it is a specific skill of newborns and make clear how important baby and nursery rhymes are for the auditory development of young children. More insight into early perception is of great importance for learning more about infant cognition and the role that musical skills may play in early development.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Switzerland has legalized “suicide pods,” 3D-printed capsules offering a “peaceful, reliable, drug-free” death, even for those with severe illnesses, according to the machine’s creator.<br><br>

                The pod operates by reducing the oxygen level with nitrogen, leading to cerebral hypoxia, unconsciousness, and death—all within minutes, without drugs.<br><br>

                Philip Nitschke, a former physician who created the device: “I’ve always wanted to remove the role [and the] need for professional people to prescribe difficult drugs to use. The person will get into the capsule and lie down. It's very comfortable. They will be asked a number of questions and when they have answered, they may press the button inside the capsule activating the mechanism in their own time. …  There is no panic, no choking feeling.”

                LeBron James wrote on X that he is thinking of live-streaming Madden.<br><br>

                James: “Thinking of live streaming my @EAMaddenNFL games when I play. Who should I stream with? Meaning which platform brand.”<br><br>

                The head of Strategic Partnerships for Kick, a streaming platform, responded: “Time to work.”<br><br>

                If James were to start streaming, he would certainly receive an incredibly lucrative deal. In June, popular streamer xQc signed a $100 million deal with Kick after he left Twitch, which matches traditional athletes’ contracts.

                Photos of Ford models displaying a “your vehicle cannot be driven” message went viral this month, leading to discussions about the reliability of over-the-air (OTA) updates in the vehicles.<br><br>

                Concerns arise as vehicles increasingly depend on software, mirroring the infamous “blue screen of death” from early Windows systems, but now potentially stranding drivers.<br><br>

                Critics argue that failed updates should automatically revert to the last working state to avoid this issue.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A 31-year-old man is receiving praise for honoring his close friend’s dying wish by taking her virginity before she passed away from cancer.<br><br>

                The anonymous man explained the situation on Reddit, wondering if he made a mistake.<br><br>

                “One night when we were all drinking she admitted to me she was still a virgin but she doesn’t want to lose it to just any stranger—at least somebody she trusts before she goes,” he wrote.<br><br>

                “That person was me. She didn’t force me to do anything I didn’t want to, she asked but was willing to drop it and pretend it never happened if I decided no.”<br><br>

                The man explained they booked a hotel room and set up fake candles to make it “extra special” and “more romantic.”<br><br>

                “It was the first time I ever had sex with someone I loved but wasn’t in love with, if that makes sense. It was still a very intense experience—not in a bad way, there were a lot of emotions.”<br><br>

                “It’s just hard because I miss her so much. But I’m still glad at least I got to give her something before she left,” he concluded.<br><br>

                Commenters swiftly reassured him that he'd done the right thing, with his post amassing more than 28,000 upvotes when it was first uploaded two years ago.<br><br>

                One user wrote: “This is a beautiful, beautiful story, man. You did so right by her. I’m sorry for your loss, she seemed like an amazing woman.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The 2020s will be the slowest-growing decade in American history if the current U.S. growth pace continues.<br><br>

                Previously, the slowest growing decade was the 1930s, when the Great Depression ruptured American society.<br><br>

                On January 1, the U.S. population will be nearly 336 million, up nearly two million from last year. That’s just a 0.53% increase.<br><br>

                In January, 4.3 births are expected worldwide every second. In the U.S., only one birth is expected every nine seconds.<br><br>

                This trend comes as the world experiences record-low birth rates. In 2023, America’s fertility rate was 1.84 births per woman. In 1960, the rate was 3.65.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Russia has launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, resulting in at least 30 civilian deaths and damage across multiple cities.<br><br>

                The bombardment lasted about 18 hours and targeted various civilian infrastructures, including a maternity hospital, apartment blocks, and schools, leaving at least 144 people wounded and more under rubble. It included 122 missiles and dozens of drones.<br><br>

                Ukraine’s military chief said the air force intercepted most of the missiles and drones overnight.<br><br>

                In a statement, Biden said that the bombardment illustrates how Putin must be stopped, “but unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs to protect its people. Congress must step up and act.” Yesterday, Biden approved $250 million in aid for Ukraine, the last package of this year.<br><br>

                Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the scale of the attack should wake people up to Ukraine’s continuing needs.<br><br>

                “Today, millions of Ukrainians awoke to the loud sound of explosions,” he wrote on X. “I wish those sounds of explosions in Ukraine could be heard all around the world. In all major capitals, headquarters, and parliaments, which are currently debating further support for Ukraine.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A new study finds that emojis activate brain regions responsible for processing emotions, with people who frequently use positive emojis tending to be more agreeable and extroverted.<br><br>

                The study involved 222 participants who completed various personality tests and had various aspects of their emoji usage analyzed, including frequency, motivation, attitudes, and preferences.<br><br>

                Researchers concluded that prosocial behavior was associated with all aspects of emoji usage. Among the personality traits, agreeableness was the only one that showed a significant correlation with the frequency of emoji use. Prosocial behavior, extraversion, and agreeableness were also predictive of a preference for positive emojis.

                2023 saw a strong U.S. stock market, heavily influenced by the “Magnificent Seven”: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla, which saw individual gains between 50% and 240%.<br><br>

                These tech giants were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the S&P 500's 24% gain this year, making it the market's “most crowded” trade, according to fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research. Now, investors are wondering if they should ride the momentum into 2024 or diversify into other areas.<br><br>

                While the rally in tech stocks has been robust, there are signs of a broadening market with the equal-weight S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 showing significant gains in December, indicating a potential shift for the coming year.<br><br>

                Jonathan Cofsky, portfolio manager, Janus Henderson Investors: “When you have seven companies that are huge in the index all going up, that is good for the market. But I think there are probably more opportunities in the rest of the market, depending on rates and the economy.”

            <h3 class="hecho">China's Rise Is Reversing</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                China’s share of the global economy is falling by the most since the 1960s, when communist leader Mao Zedong ruled the country.<br><br>

                The country’s GDP share is set to decline from 18.4% in 2021 to 17% in 2023, a historic decline of 1.4 percentage points.<br><br>

                Key reasons for this shift include increased government intervention, debt issues, slowed productivity, and declining foreign investment. Net foreign investment in China-listed shares this year has dropped 87%, or about $29 billion, meaning this year could mark the smallest year of foreign inflows since 2015.<br><br>

                Investors largely pulled their money because of fears surrounding China’s slowed economy, which has failed to sustain its rebound since COVID amid a crumbling real estate sector, massive debts, and falling consumer demand.<br><br>

                Ruchir Sharma, Chairman of Rockefeller International: “In a historic turn, China's rise as an economic superpower is reversing. The biggest global story of the past half century may be over.”<br><br>

                He continued: “China's decline could reorder the world. Since the 1990s, the country's share of global GDP grew mainly at the expense of Europe and Japan, which have seen their shares hold more or less steady over the past two years. The gap left by China has been filled mainly by the U.S. and by other emerging nations. But almost no matter what Xi does, his nation's share in the global economy is likely to decline for the foreseeable future. It's a post-China world now.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Superhero movies underperformed at the box office this year, following a decade of marvelous success.<br><br>

                “The Marvels” became the lowest-grossing movie in the 15-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was the first MCU title to fall short of $100 million domestically.<br><br>

                DC also underperformed with “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” which had a disappointing $40 million opening over the four-day Christmas weekend. The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, had a $67.8 opening. To make matters worse, “Lost Kingdom” marks the end of the DC Extended Universe.<br><br>

                Other sequels for franchises like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “The Flash” drew less money than their predecessors, despite the latter even bringing back Michael Keaton as Batman.<br><br>

                Not all superhero movies flopped, though. Sony’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” received immense critical and commercial acclaim, doubling the box office from “Into the Spider-Verse.”<br><br>

                Overall, 2023 had the highest-grossing domestic box office since COVID, with $8.7 billion—a figure that is still nowhere close to the $10 billion-$11 billion from the pre-pandemic years.

                A human translator who worked for Duolingo for five years posted on Reddit that the company has “offboarded” a “huge percentage” of translators because of AI.<br><br>

                The user wrote on the Duolingo subreddit: “In December 2023, Duolingo ‘off boarded’ a huge percentage of their contractors who did translations. Of course this is because they figured out that AI can do these translations in a fraction of the time. Plus it saves them money. I’m just curious, as a user how do you feel knowing that sentences and translations are coming from AI instead of human beings? Does it matter?”<br><br>

                The user then attached a screenshot of an email from Duolingo notifying them that they would no longer be working there. The user wrote in a comment on Reddit: “Here’s the final email I got two weeks ago. Just in case you wanted to see it. I worked there for five years. Our team had four core members and two of us got the boot. The two who remained will just review AI content to make sure it’s acceptable.”<br><br>

                Other Redditors expressed disappointment at the company’s decision.<br><br>

                One user wrote: “Lame ass move. I expect a lot of other companies are/will be doing the same thing. How long until we have a serious conversation about regulating AI for businesses and professional usage?”<br><br>

                Another user seemed to recognize the situation was futile: “As long as the learning material is correct, I don't mind whether it is human or AI generated. That's my opinion strictly from a Duolingo user POV. Obviously, from a general perspective, it sucks that people are losing their jobs. But what can you do?”

                A Florida woman has filed a $5 billion lawsuit against The Hershey Company, claiming deceptive advertising of their Reese's seasonal chocolates. The lawsuit says customers were deceived because the treats don’t actually have the jack-o-lantern faces shown on the packaging.<br><br>

                The products in dispute include Reese's seasonal shapes like pumpkins, ghosts, bats, and snowmen. Cynthia Kelly says the actual chocolates don't include details like mouths and eyes that the packaging shows.<br><br>

                The lawsuit reads: “Hershey’s labels for the Products are materially misleading and numerous consumers have been tricked and misled by the pictures on the Products’ packaging. Reese’s, what are you doing? Look at the picture on the packet. It’s like a pumpkin with faces and a little mouth—then you open up the packet and you are presented with that monstrosity.”<br><br>

                Kelly's lawsuit also includes links to YouTube videos where others criticize Hershey's for similar reasons. In addition to $5 billion, the filing demands a redesign of the packaging to prevent future confusion.

                A hotel in Bangkok has removed a giant demon statue in front of its entrance after the State Railway of Thailand ordered it be removed by December 30.<br><br>

                The statue, which depicted a winged demon with fangs and crimson talons, faced widespread criticism. Critics like the Council of Artists Supporting Thai Buddhism argued the statue encouraged “un-Buddhist and scary” practices, including the sacrifice of animals.<br><br>

                Reportedly, the statue inspired the creation of online groups that discussed their devotion to the demon, a mythical figure said to be the teacher of Jayavarman VII, a former king of the Khmer empire. Some worshippers also reportedly regarded him as a god of wealth.<br><br>

                The hotel’s operator has been ordered to pay a fine of 1.3 million baht ($37,800).<br><br>

                Buddhist leader Phra Phayom Kalayano advised citizens to be cautious, saying they should only worship spiritual beings like the Buddha or Jesus, as role models of goodness.

                Trump is back on the presidential primary ballot in Colorado, the state’s secretary of state announced, after the Colorado GOP appealed the state’s ban to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>

                Last week, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump was ineligible to run for president because he incited insurrection on January 6, 2021, violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court banned him from the ballot, but postponed the ban until January 4, allowing the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case if needed.<br><br>

                Yesterday, the Colorado Republican Party filed an appeal to the decision, taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>

                Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced that Trump will for the time being remain on the ballot, which goes to print on January 5, unless the U.S. Supreme Court affirms Colorado’s decision or otherwise declines to take on the appeal.<br><br>

                The announcement comes one day after Michigan’s Supreme Court rejected the argument that Trump is ineligible to run for president.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Attacks in Nigeria on Christmas Eve have left at least 160 Christians dead and 300 others injured.<br><br>

                They targeted 20 Christian villages and continued into Christmas Day. 221 houses were burned.<br><br>

                The Christian Association of Nigeria condemned the attacks, with its president, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, saying in a statement: “We condemn these acts of violence in the strongest possible terms. The burning down of houses, and worship centers, and the destruction of properties worth millions of naira is not only a criminal act but also a direct assault on our shared values of peace, unity, and mutual respect.”<br><br>

                A Catholic organization called Intersociety said the massacre “was likely a clandestine government-coordinated revenge killing using the government-protected Fulani Jihadists to launch a reprisal attack over the December 3 killing of over 120 defenseless Islamic festival celebrants in Tudun Biri part of Kaduna State.”<br><br>

                Intersociety was referencing the 120 Muslims who were killed by two airstrikes coordinated by the Nigerian Armed Forces. The military said it was an accident.<br><br>

                Experts say Nigeria has more Christian martyrs than anywhere else on Earth. Of the 5,500 Christians killed last year, 90% were Nigerian, with estimates that 4,500 Christian Nigerians have been murdered this year. Activists claim that Nigeria’s government favors Muslims and turns a blind eye to Islamic terrorism against Christians.

                Prehistoric people cut off their fingers for religious rituals, a new study of Paleolithic cave art claims.<br><br>

                To arrive at this conclusion, archaeologists noticed that the practice of finger amputation spanned Africa, Australia, North America, and Asia. They also pointed out that a group of women from the New Guinea Highlands “sometimes had one or more fingers cut off following the death of loved ones.”<br><br>

                Archaeologists: “We believe that Europeans were doing the same sort of thing in Paleolithic times, though the precise belief systems involved may have been different. This is a practice that was not necessarily routine but has occurred at various times through history, we believe.”<br><br>

                The study analyzed over 200 handprints missing at least one finger from 25,000-year-old cave paintings in France and Spain. Until now, missing fingers have been attributed to artistic liberty or medical issues such as frostbite.<br><br>

                Mark Collard, archaeologist: “There is compelling evidence that these people may have had their fingers amputated deliberately in rituals intended to elicit help from supernatural entities.”

                Coyotes are the likely culprit, the scientists say. The phenomenon, baffling experts, has seen increasing incidents of harbor and elephant seal pups being targeted.<br><br>

                Marine ecologist Sarah Codde, one of these puzzled experts, enlisted the help of a doctoral student, who set up a camera at a location known for these seals and caught the attackers in the act.<br><br>

                Frankie Gerraty, the doctoral student: “Coyotes are underappreciated predators in shoreline ecosystems, and marine mammals are the largest and most calorically rich nutrient parcels in the ocean.”<br><br>

                Researchers suggest the changing landscape and behavior of seals, along with the intruding coyote population, may require new conservation strategies.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                31% of Republican voters say they have low trust that votes will be counted correctly during the upcoming presidential primary.<br><br>

                A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that among Republicans, 37% said they had either "a great deal" or "quite a bit" of faith in the outcome of their party's primary, while 31% said they had "a moderate amount" of trust, and 31% said they had "only a little" or "none at all."<br><br>

                In contrast, 72% of Democrats had at least “quite a bit” of faith in their party's vote count. Only 8% said they had “only a little or none at all.” Independents are largely unconfident in both parties.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A U.S. appeals court has granted Apple an emergency request to temporarily pause a national sales ban on Apple Watch models.<br><br>

                The ban, enacted yesterday, was due to a ruling from the International Trade Commission that stated Apple infringed on technology company Masimo’s pulse-oximeter technology, which monitors blood oxygen levels. Apple has included the feature in every watch since its 2020 Series 6 model, meaning all watches since then were banned, except for the small Apple Watch SE.<br><br>

                Apple argued that the ban would cause “irreparable harm” to its business, potentially costing the company between $300 and $400 million in lost sales. The court's decision allows Apple to continue selling its watches while the appeal is considered.

                Over 3,800 people have signed a petition since 2020 to remove Trump's star, arguing that “Trump has fostered and promoted innumerable racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, antisemitic, and autocratic sentiments.” The resident behind the petition is now urging city officials to remove the star, asking: “How are we the voters supposed to have faith in the city council to deal with any real level of challenge if they can't get this done?”<br><br>

                At least one city council member told the Los Angeles Times that he would support the removal.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Beer sales in the U.S. are expected to hit their lowest level since 1999.

                According to Beer Marketer’s Insights, sales declined by more than 5% in the first nine months of the year, dragged down by boycotts of Bud Light and the changing habits of younger drinkers.<br><br>

                Bud Light faced backlash from conservatives following its collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The brand’s sales have steadily declined each month by 25% to 30% since the collaboration in April, unseating Bud Light as the top-selling beer in the U.S. after two decades.<br><br>

                Other beers, such as Modelo, Coors Light, and Miller Lite, captured some of Bud Light’s lost market share, but their upticks weren’t enough to account for Bud Light’s decline.<br><br>

                Overall, beer sales have been hit as younger Americans have increasingly replaced beer with other alcoholic beverages like canned cocktails or stopped drinking entirely. A study published last year found that teens in 2022 drank far less or were sober more often throughout their high school years than teens in 1999 to 2001.

The design was later emulated by nearly every firearms maker, becoming the standard for 21st-century semi-automatic handguns.<br><br>

                In 1999, Glock survived a rubber hammer attack set up by a business associate, who hired a former wrestler to attack Glock with the weapon.

                Workers in 22 states and dozens of localities will see increased minimum wages starting January 1, with many hitting at least $15 per hour.<br><br>

                Specifically, this change affects 65 cities, counties, and states due to cost-of-living adjustments in existing laws. Later in the year, three more states and 22 localities will further raise their minimum wages, with some areas aiming for a $17 or even $20 wage. This movement results from campaigns like the Fight for $15, which began in fast food in 2012.<br><br>

                Despite no federal increase since 2007, the state and local hikes reflect the success of ballot referendums and legislation, as well as the need to keep up with inflation and a tight labor market.

                A new survey from consulting firm Gartner finds that 53% of consumers think the current state of social media is worse than it was in the prior year or five years ago. Based on these findings, Gartner predicts that 50% of consumers will “abandon or significantly limit their interactions with social media by 2025.”<br><br>

                The top reasons consumers listed for this decline were the spread of misinformation, toxicity, and bots. Over 70% also agreed that AI will harm user experience. As a result, brands are expected to emphasize “AI-free” experiences by 2027.<br><br>

                A separate poll last week found that 80% of Americans think AI content posing as human-made should be illegal, underscoring the weariness users have toward AI.<br><br>

                Emily Weiss, researcher: “Social media remains the top investment channel for digital marketing, but consumers are actively trying to limit their use. A significant slice says that, compared to a few years ago, they are sharing less of their own lives and content.”

                The requirement was included in the annual defense authorization bill passed by Congress earlier this month, calling for “a study to assess and evaluate any health conditions and adverse events arising in service members on active duty one year after receiving the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.” Results will be reported to Congress in December 2024.<br><br>

                The study will look at “any health condition developed after receiving such first dose, regardless of whether the condition is attributable to the receipt of such first dose,” and “an accounting of adverse events including hyperimmune response” linked to the vaccine.”<br><br>

                The poll asked 1,000 likely voters for one word to describe what both candidates seek in a second term. For Biden, the prevailing word was “nothing,” followed by “economy,” and “peace.” Trump was associated with “revenge,” “power,” and “dictatorship.”<br><br>

                James Johnson, pollster: “Biden may not have set the world alight three years ago but he was the candidate of calm, and recovery from the pandemic. Now he is the nothing man.

                Reviving “zombie viruses,” which are viruses that have laid dormant for tens of thousands of years and could provide insight into current diseases. Scientists discovered these diseases are still infectious when inserting them into culture cells.<br><br>

                “Our reasoning is that if the amoeba viruses are still alive, there is no reason why the other viruses will not be still alive, and capable of infecting their own hosts,” a scientist said.<br><br>

                Resurrecting extinct creatures like the dodo and wooly mammoth by incorporating advances in ancient DNA sequencing, gene-editing technology, and synthetic biology. Scientists can accomplish this feat by discovering cells belonging to extinct species and growing them successfully in embryos belonging to related species.<br><br>

                In the case of the dodo, scientists have found that their cells can grow successfully in a chicken embryo. “Physically, the restored dodo will be indiscernible from what we know of the dodo’s appearance,” a geneticist told CNN.

                McDonald’s has tapped into nostalgia in the past few years to retain connections with customers, its chief marketing and customer experience officer says.<br><br>

                A few years ago, Tariq Hassan says, McDonald’s “lost our connection with our customer. And as a result of that, ultimately, we lost the meaning of ‘I’m loving it.’”<br><br>

                When Hassan joined the company, he pushed the brand to connect with popular culture by embracing nostalgia. In 2020, the company tweeted: “one day you ordered a Happy Meal for the last time and you didn't even know it.” The tweet gained immense traction, suggesting nostalgia was the missing ingredient.<br><br>

Previous research has used high voltage to stimulate the roots, but this new research involves very low energy consumption and no high voltage danger.<br><br>

                Eleni Stavrinidou, researcher: “The world population is increasing, and we also have climate change.

                In 2007, about 3,000 Palestinian Christians lived in Gaza. Now, there are only about 800 to 1,000.<br><br>

                Mitri Raheb, pastor and founder of Dar al-Kalima University in Bethlehem: “I’m not sure if they will survive the Israeli bombing, and even if they survive, I think many of them will want to emigrate,” adding that the Christian community is “under threat of extinction.”<br><br>

                Before the current conflict, the Christian community in Gaza was shrinking by 5% on an average year as young Gazans emigrated because of what they saw as oppressive Israeli restrictions.<br><br>

                Churches in the territory have not been spared by Israel—on October 19, the Saint Porphyrius Church was hit during an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, killing 18 people, including nine children, and injuring nearly 100 people.<br><br>

                Additionally, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced last week that an Israeli sniper murdered two Christian women inside a church in Gaza and that Israel fired rockets at a convent that cares for over 54 disabled people.<br><br>

                Pope Francis condemned the attacks: “I continue to receive very serious and painful news from Gaza. Unarmed civilians are subjected to bombings and shootings.

                The bottles, sent by members of the U.S.-based North Korean Freedom Coalition (NKFC), also each contain enough rice to feed a family of four for a week, a $1 bill, and North Korean music. The activists changed the lyrics from worshiping Kim Jong Un to praising God.<br><br>

                Suzanne Scholte, chairwoman of the NKFC: “We should be doing everything we can to get information into North Korea by land, by sea, and by air. Operation Truth is modeled after the Berlin Airlift, to get critical help to the starving people of North Korea.”<br><br>

                Scholte’s Christmas message included in the bottles says: “Christmas, which is celebrated all over the world on December 25th, marks the day when Jesus was born...Many of your ancestors also believed in Jesus. In fact, in 1907, in Pyongyang, there were so many Christians who believed in Jesus that Pyongyang became known as a Holy City. But when Kim II Sung came to power, he wanted North Koreans to worship him as a god, and not the one true God. So, he killed many Christian leaders, sent others to political prison camps, or banished them. He did all he could to kill the followers of Jesus Christ.”

                Despite economic pessimism and sluggish October spending, the increase might be driven by consumer interest in early retail promotions and significant “excess savings” from the pandemic.<br><br>

                A poll from November found 27% of Americans are “doom spending,” or spending more money than they have to combat stress.

                A check signed by Steve Jobs has sold for $46,063 at auction.<br><br>

                Issued by "Apple Computer Company" in 1976, the $4.01 check was made out to electronics retailer RadioShack.<br><br>

                Jobs filled out the check on July 23, 1976, when he and Steve Wozniak were working on the Apple-1 computer.<br><br>

                The RadioShack check lists a Palo Alto address for an answering service and a mail drop-off point that Jobs used while Apple was being run out of his parent's garage.<br><br>

                The auction house expected the check to sell for at least $25,000, but it sold for more—Apple and Steve Jobs memorabilia has been fetching higher and higher prices in recent years.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The UN considers Finland’s sauna culture an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity,” and based on how much Finnish people celebrate the staple, that may not be an overstatement.<br><br>

                The Finnish city Tampere, known as the "sauna capital of the world," boasts about 60 public saunas in a city of 250,000 people, with many people having saunas in their own homes.<br><br>

                Saunas in Finland serve multiple community roles, from therapy spaces and social hubs to places for relaxation and reflection.<br><br>

                The Finnish sauna experience, centered around the concept of löyly, is a blend of physical, mental, and spiritual wellness.<br><br>

                Alexander Lembke, sauna expert: “You just do it, help them. There you can see how deeply rooted the sauna is here in the community.”<br><br>

                Anita Kontukoski, sauna enthusiast: “That’s the best way to start your free time and forget all the stresses of the week.”<br><br>

                Given that Finland has been ranked the happiest country in the world for the past six years, there’s certainly a connection to the country’s celebration of saunas.

                When asked about the inspiration for this event, DaBaby credited his mom: “I always remember my mom, even when we had less, like when we didn't have enough, when we were barely holding on, when she was making ends meet, I always remember her going outside and us helping others. There's not a time in my life that my mama wasn't helping somebody else.”<br><br>

                “Now that I'm blessed enough to be able to do the same thing, like to go up and put on a positive example on how to do what I saw my mama doing growing up, man, and just give back to people.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The Mormon church has acquired around 370,000 acres in Nebraska, putting its total U.S. agricultural holdings at a value of at least $2 billion.<br><br>

                At this current rate, the institution is on track to surpass CNN founder Ted Turner as the single largest landowner in Nebraska. Across the U.S., the church’s 895,000 acres are more than China’s (383,935 acres) and Bill Gates’ (270,000) combined.<br><br>

                John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, criticized the church's land purchases for driving up prices and displacing local farmers: “It's not fair competition when folks bring in that much outside money and bid against local farmers and ranchers.”<br><br>

                The church's total U.S. land, including Florida and Nebraska properties, is valued at up to $12 billion, with a significant portion managed by for-profit and nonprofit subsidiaries.<br><br>

                Critics question the transparency and intent behind the church's vast real estate investments, while supporters point to its history of responsible land stewardship. Some wonder if the institution is prepping for a doomsday scenario as foretold in its teachings.<br><br>

                Reports estimate the church could be worth as much as $1 trillion in 20 years. Some members have sued in past years, accusing the institution of misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.

                CNN took the average of its past two polls that asked about a potential Biden-Trump matchup, which each surveyed 100 voters who were born in another country. The findings surprised many analysts, who thought the Biden campaign repeatedly comparing Trump to Hitler would harm Trump’s image among immigrants.<br><br>

                CNN: “If this holds, it would be a major shift from the 2020 election, when Biden won immigrant voters by about 20 points.”<br><br>

                A separate poll from November found that the top concern among immigrant voters isn’t immigration or border security but economic concerns, including inflation. This may explain their increased support for Trump, who has painted the economy under Biden as a disaster.

                Women are suddenly finding videos on porn websites that appear to depict them doing sex, despite them never starring in any such videos.<br><br>

                Instead, someone or a group of people are grabbing images from women’s social media pages and running them through an AI to transpose their faces onto the bodies of porn actresses.<br><br>

                Some videos are so realistic that one would need to carefully study the face to notice its artificiality.<br><br>

                Naturally, much of the content involves celebrities, but resentful ex-boyfriends, stalkers, and otherwise nefarious actors are increasingly targeting normal women.<br><br>

                People can now even download “face-swapping” apps that perform the job, and a website called “DeepNude” generates 100 pictures of naked women for just $29.95 a month when you feed it reference images.<br><br>

                This phenomenon has even spread to schools, such as one New Jersey high school where students were caught sharing AI-generated nudes of a female classmate.<br><br>

                In September, a bill was introduced to criminalize “extremely harmful” online deepfakes, but the language of bills like these is vague enough that many incidents would likely go unpunished.<br><br>

                Henry Adjer, researcher of AI: “Previously, you would have to have had intimate experience with a person to capture that content. Now, you don't… if you've got access to their social media profiles, as many classmates or colleagues do, and there are lots of pictures of them on there, that's all you need.”

                In June 2020, following BLM protests, both companies declared their intent to increase diversity in leadership positions by 30% as of 2025. Now, however, the companies have cut development training for under-represented employees and fired employees who worked in diversity programs.<br><br>

                Specifically, Google has laid off diversity leaders who worked with its chief diversity officer, while Meta has fired over 60 employees working on diversity initiatives. Analysts see this as a sign that the pressure from BLM has started to wane and companies are returning to a profit-maximizing mindset. <br><br>

                Speaking with CNBC, both companies maintained that diversity remains a key commitment.<br><br>

                Jeff Bezos is backing a real estate investing startup called Arrived that has been buying up single-family homes and turning them into rental properties since 2021.<br><br>

                The company has allowed customers to invest in these rental properties for as little as $100, and now, it plans to allow customers to easily invest in a broad portfolio of its rental housing.<br><br>

                Critics argue this will increasingly turn the housing market into a growing collection of mini-landlords.<br><br>

                The startup’s CEO, Ryan Frazier, conceded the company is capitalizing on the lack of affordable housing in America: “The single-family home residential home market has just been so undersupplied for more than the last decade and the supply of properties in the market is lower now … as mortgage interest rates have gone up. At the same time, interest from individuals in renting properties is also going up.”<br><br>

                In addition to Bezos, Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi are among the investors.<br><br>

                This comes as a new analysis from Business Insider found that 44% of single-family home purchases in Q3 of 2023 were done by private equity firms.

                The Supreme Court won’t say for now if Trump is immune from prosecution for his alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election.<br><br>

                Special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the prosecution effort against the former president, had requested urgent consideration on the issue of immunity. The Supreme Court denied the request today in a one-line order without explaining.<br><br>

                A federal appeals court is simultaneously racing to consider the issue, but Smith hoped to skip right to the Supreme Court. Once the appeals court gets to the issue, it could send the matter back to the nine justices in early 2024.<br><br>

                Because Trump is the first former president in American history to face criminal charges, the issue of immunity remains unclear. A Department of Justice policy prohibits the indictment of a sitting president, but there’s no such rule for a former commander-in-chief. Trump’s lawyers maintain he cannot be charged as he was acting in his official capacity as president during the 2020 election.

                The pardon would apply to the thousands convicted of the possession of marijuana for their personal use on federal lands and in Washington, D.C. Importantly, it doesn’t apply to people who have been convicted for selling the drug.<br><br>

                Biden is also granting clemency to 11 people serving what the White House called “disproportionately long” sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.<br><br>

                Biden: “Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs. Just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the use or possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either.”<br><br>

                While many are applauding the effort, some are pointing out its timing, less than a year before the 2024 presidential election, and wondering if this is another pitch to voters, like Biden’s forgiveness of student loans.

                It was especially evident in November’s Dutch election, in which the victorious right-wing Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, fared even better among voters under age 35 than it did overall.<br><br>

                Notably, young voters are prioritizing issues like the housing crisis and the rising cost of healthcare over culture war topics—to these young people, left-wing candidates simply aren’t addressing what matters.<br><br>

                Another user sent: “I just shit my pants.” In response, the mayor texted back: “Hey, it’s your Mayor, Eric! Thank you for reaching out.”<br><br>

                Others took a different approach: “Resign you fucking criminal. You should be in prison,” one person texted.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Putin expressed confidence that the Western financial system is becoming outdated because of emerging technologies and that it could lose its dominant position in the globe in the near future.<br><br>

                Addressing an investment forum in Moscow, Putin said: “According to experts, in the coming years this will lead to a real revolution that will finally undermine the monopoly of large Western banks.”<br><br>

                He emphasized that modern technologies like blockchain are increasingly used in international payments, leaving Western financial institutions “not in the best condition.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The Los Angeles Police Department has purchased a mass surveillance software called WebLoc from Cobwebs Technologies, an Israeli company.<br><br>

                This software allows the LAPD to track individuals using geolocation data, and it also includes image and face recognition.<br><br>

                The contract costs the LAPD about $200,000 per year and allows them to gather data from social media, the dark web, and mobile data brokers, raising privacy concerns of potentially bypassing warrant requirements.<br><br>

                Geolocation data in particular has been increasingly used by the feds: for instance, it was a primary tool used by the federal government in tracking down January 6 participants.<br><br>

                The Fourth Amendment protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures, but courts have ruled there’s an exception to this rule when “foreign surveillance” and “national security” are involved.

                The footage, posted on Instagram by tourism company Netzero Expeditions, was accompanied by the caption: “This magnificent creature, with a massive weight of 6,000 kg (13K lbs) and capable of speeds up to 56 km/h (35 mph), showcased a striking example of kinetic energy in the natural world. During its hunting maneuver, the orca generated a staggering 727,087.87 Joules of energy, comparable to the force of over 450 professional boxer’s punches or a compact car moving at 60 km/h colliding with a wall — all concentrated in a single, breathtaking instant.”<br><br>

                France has closed its embassy in Niger after most of the staff left earlier this year following a coup.<br><br>

                The African nation, which was formerly colonized by France, has seen widespread anti-French sentiment after a coup in July removed the previous leadership that had ties with the European power. The French embassy was attacked shortly after.<br><br>

                French sources: “After the attack on our embassy July 30, and the setting up of a blockade around our building by Niger forces, most of our diplomatic staff left in late September. The French embassy in Niger is therefore no longer able to function normally or fulfill its missions. Taking note of this situation, we have decided to close our embassy.”<br><br>

                The remaining French troops in Niger are expected to withdraw this month.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Republican Congressman Tim Burchett said in a podcast interview that members of Congress are blackmailed right when they’re about to make a key vote.<br><br>

                Burchett’s comments came in response to conservative podcaster Benny Johnson asking him why it took so long for Epstein’s client list to be unsealed by a federal judge, noting that Senator Marsha Blackburn has been essentially blackballed in the Senate for asking for that information.<br><br>

                Burchett: “Why in the world would good conservatives vote for stuff like what we’ve been seeing out of Congress? Here’s how it works. You’re visiting, you’re out of the country or out of town or you’re in a motel or at a bar in DC and, whatever you’re into – women, men, whatever — comes up and they’re very attractive and they’re laughing at your jokes. And you’re buying them a drink. Next thing you know, you’re in the motel room with them naked.”<br><br>

                “And next thing you know, you know you’re about to make a key vote. And what happens? Some well-dressed person comes out and whispers in your ear, ‘Hey, man, there’s tapes out on you.’ Or, ‘Were you in a motel room or whatever with whoever?’ And then you’re like, ‘Oh,’ and they say, ‘You really ought not be voting for this thing.’”<br><br>

                “You know? And what do they do? It’s human nature. And, you know, no man or no woman actually is an island. And they know what to get at. You know, if it’s women, drugs, booze, it’ll find you. And they say, and in most elected offices, and that’s what people of power and influence do. And it’s just, you know, I’ve been in this game my whole life. I spent 16 years in the state legislature in Tennessee and eight years as county mayor. And now I’m in my fifth year Congress. But it’s just — the stakes are higher. But the game is still the same.”<br><br>

                Later in the interview, Burchett said Kevin Spacey’s “House of Cards” was more like a documentary than fiction.

                The infamous hack was made while he was already on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT/EE and in police protection at a Travelodge hotel. While there, he used the TV, an Amazon Firestick, and a mobile phone to breach Rockstar Games, the developer of GTA.<br><br>

                Despite being autistic and deemed unfit to stand trial, the hacker was found by a judge to be a high risk to the public due to his skills and desire to commit cybercrime. As a result, he was ordered to remain in a secure hospital for life or until he was deemed no longer a danger.<br><br>

                His cyber-attacks are part of a broader campaign by the Lapsus$ group, causing nearly $10 million in damages to firms like Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar Games. A 17-year-old accomplice received an 18-month Youth Rehabilitation Order.

                Musician Nick Cave is set to have his debut commercial exhibition, “The Devil—A Life,” in Brussels at Xavier Hufkens Gallery in April 2024, featuring 17 glazed ceramic figurines.<br><br>

                The collection narrates the cradle-to-grave story of the Devil, presenting him as an everyday character with flaws and complexities, echoing Shakespeare’s “Seven Ages of Man.”<br><br>

                Cave is known for his musical and literary works, exploring themes of absolution, forgiveness, and the moral virtue in beauty through his ceramic series.<br><br>

                The figurines stylistically draw from Victorian Staffordshire “flatback” pieces, marking a unique blend of historical influence and personal expression.<br><br>

                Cave's long-standing, though conflicted, interest in Christianity and themes of faith and the Devil permeate his body of work, adding depth to his artistic narrative. In a statement, he said the ceramic series is centered on “the idea of forgiveness, the idea that there is a moral virtue in beauty. It’s a kind of balancing of our sins.”<br><br>

                In 2010, he said: “I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it.”

                Michigan: The state’s supreme court is reviewing a case by the group Free Speech For People. Like the Colorado decision, the group argues Trump called for “insurrection” on January 6, 2021, and is therefore ineligible to run for president under the Fourteenth Amendment. Importantly, Michigan’s Supreme Court has four Democratic-leaning justices and three Republican ones.<br><br>

                Unlike Colorado, Michigan is a swing state, raising the stakes immensely for the decision.<br><br>

The letter cites the Colorado decision, saying it “can be the basis for a similar decision here in our state. The constitution is clear: you must be 35 years old and not be an insurrectionist.”<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A mother was fed up with her daughter’s school lunch being stolen by the school bully, Billy, so she took matters into her own hands.<br><br>

                She decided to lace the food with laxatives to identify the student sneakily stealing her lunch.<br><br>

                The mom wrote in a social media post: “I brought the issue to her teacher and principal, but they didn’t seem to care. Both suggested she might have just been losing it.”<br><br>

                She told her daughter to keep an eye out for any student “urgently” needing to use the bathroom, and sure enough, her daughter saw a young boy rush to the toilet. Over a few days, the pattern repeated.<br><br>

                Now, her daughter is facing suspension, because the young boy told the school what had been happening. <br><br>

                One user on social media offered their thoughts: “You’re publicly admitting to poisoning a child.”<br><br>

                Another mother chimed in: “Ask the mother why Billy needs your daughter’s food. Tell them she never would have given it to him because of the laxatives.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Researchers at the University of New Mexico are engineering a vaccine that targets high cholesterol.<br><br>

                The vaccine, which could be available within a decade, has been shown to lower cholesterol by nearly 30% in animal studies. It is expected to be affordable, with the estimated cost per dose under $100, cheaper than other cholesterol-reducing injections.<br><br>

                Dr. Bryce Chackerian, lead researcher: “This is a vaccine that we think can have a global impact. So, not just in the U.S., but around the world where heart disease is a significant problem.”<br><br>

                Around the world, cholesterol kills almost 18 million adults every year.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists in China have developed a method for extracting uranium from ordinary seawater, which may provide humanity with an effectively unlimited energy source.<br><br>

                According to current estimates, there are about 4.5 billion tons of uranium in the sea, in the form of dissolved uranyl ions. This energy source—essentially over a billion years worth of nuclear fuel—has been largely untapped due to extraction methods proving largely unsuccessful.<br><br>

                To extract the uranium, the team has engineered a flexible cloth that is woven from carbon fibers and coated with a special treatment. The cloth provides tiny pockets that capture the uranium.<br><br>

                In tests, 12.6 mg of uranium per gram of water were extracted over 24 days, a higher amount and faster rate than any previous extraction method. With these optimistic results, the scientists hope to expand their method to encompass a grander scale.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Young Americans who supported Biden in the 2020 election have increasingly drawn their support, sparked by his handling of issues like student debt and the Israel conflict.<br><br>

                A New York Times poll conducted last week found that for voters between 18 and 29, nearly 75% disapprove of the way Biden is handling the Israel conflict. Among registered voters in this age group, they say they would vote for Trump over Biden, with 49% to 43%.<br><br>

                Additionally, a Pew Research Center survey earlier this month found that only 19% of voters under 30 approve of Biden’s approach toward Israel.<br><br>

                NBC News spoke to some of these young voters who aren’t fond of Biden.<br><br>

                McKenzie, 23: “I genuinely could not live with myself if I voted for someone who’s made the decisions that Biden has.”<br><br>

                Camarena, 24: “It’s so complicated, because it almost feels like if I were to give my vote for Biden, I will be showing the Democratic Party that what they are putting out is enough, which is the bare minimum in my opinion.”<br><br>

                Austin, 25: “I mean, he made a lot of really big promises in his campaign and virtually none of them were followed through on. It’s kind of sad to see that the quote unquote lesser of two evils that we were all promised, is this.”<br><br>

                In addition to Israel, these young voters cited Biden’s insufficient moves at addressing climate change and inability to fully cancel student debt or codify Roe v. Wade.

                A group representing musicians in Iceland is demanding their country’s broadcaster pull from the Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to participate, citing military actions in Gaza that have killed over 19,000 people.<br><br>

                Group: “We all have a duty to take a stand against war and the killing of civilians and innocent children,” calling on the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service “not to participate in Eurovision in 2024 unless Israel is denied participation in the competition on the same grounds as Russia in the last competition.”<br><br>

                In response, the European Broadcast Union, which hosts Eurovision, said it’s a “competition for broadcasters – not governments – and the Israeli public broadcaster has participated in the Contest for 50 years.”<br><br>

                Activists have pointed out that Russia was banned from the competition last year for its military operations, questioning why the standards are different for Israel. In February 2022, the European Broadcast Union said “the inclusion of a Russian entry… would bring the competition into disrepute.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                The U.S. murder case “clearance” or solve rate has dropped significantly, from 83.7% in 1964 to 50% in 2022, according to a new report.<br><br>

                The analysis, authored by the independent Council on Criminal Justice, cites several factors likely causing this trend: better protections for the accused, weakened public relations between police and the population, and a rise in murders by strangers. The report also notes an increase in “unknown” circumstances surrounding homicides, doubling from 22% in 1985 to 43% in 2022.<br><br>

                If this trend continues, less than half of murders will be solved in 2023 and in subsequent years.<br><br>

                Ernesto Lopez, researcher: “A lower clearance rate does not automatically equate to less police effectiveness, but when factors like low trust result in less cooperation, that is a major problem for our justice system.”

                Princeton researchers have found renters paying 50% of their income toward rent have a 9% higher risk of dying in 20 years compared to those paying just 30%.<br><br>

                When people spend 70% of their income on rent, the risk increases to 12%.<br><br>

                The threat of eviction worsens the risk, with a 19% increase in mortality for those facing eviction threats and a 40% increase for those with an eviction judgment.<br><br>

                To arrive at these results, the researchers collaborated with the U.S. Census Bureau to create a dataset that allowed them to follow renters from the year 2000 on.<br><br>

                Nick Graetz, postdoctoral research associate: “We were surprised… It's an especially big problem when we consider how many people are affected by rising rents. This isn’t a rare occurrence.”

                Addressing his nation in an end-of-the-year address, Zelensky said: “We are not ready to give up, to let go, from day one to the last day this will be the same... and together we can bring this victory closer.

                Beneath Japan’s Yonaguni island are the stunning ruins of a 10,000-year-old city engineered by a lost civilization, some experts believe.<br><br>

                In 1986, a local diver discovered formations that consist of a stacked pyramid-like monument, alongside structures resembling a castle, temples, and a stadium, all of which appear to be connected by roads. Marine biologists were perplexed.<br><br>

                Some scientists theorize that this lost city was constructed by hunter-gatherers and was ultimately submerged by a natural disaster.<br><br>

                Masaaki Kimura, marine biologist: “The largest structure looks like a complicated, monolithic, stepped pyramid that rises from a depth of 25 meters.”<br><br>

                Kimura notes that a tsunami struck the island in 1771, which left 12,000 people dead and may have submerged the city underwater.<br><br>

                Other scientists are skeptical, such as Boston University professor Robert Schoch.<br><br>

                Schoch: “It's basic geology and classic stratigraphy for sandstones, which tend to break along planes and give you these very straight edges, particularly in an area with lots of faults and tectonic activity.”<br><br>

                Ultimately, the case made on both sides is convincing enough that no single conclusion has been drawn yet.

                A resurfaced study from 2020 found that 15% of Reddit content is corporate trolls manipulating public opinion.<br><br>

                Conducted by the journal Computers in Human Behavior, the study revealed that 15% of the top 100 subreddits had content likely posted by bots or corporate trolls to promote an agenda. These trolls weren’t just promoting products and services—they were using positive news articles to push a particular narrative.<br><br>

                By posting links to favorable news coverage of a company or perspective they represented, the users aimed to create an illusion of popularity and positive reception.<br><br>

                Some see this as proof of the “Dead Internet Theory,” which argues much of the content we see online is not posted organically but by bots or paid promoters to push a narrative.

This is entirely changing how we design buildings and cities in the future. It will be less about the individual designs of the architects and more about contributing toward the quality of a city.”<br><br>

                “That means what we have to leave behind is egotism. Any architect will have to leave behind a little of their self-absorption to focus on the greater good, which is something we urgently need in society. With this, the star-architect, which of course I appreciate, from Frank Gehry to Zaha Hadid, will take a back seat to designing in order to benefit a city.”<br><br>

                AI has already achieved wonders in architecture—in China, for instance, an AI company has developed architectural technology that over 50,000 people use to design buildings, like a 500-room hotel complex, in minutes.

                On December 9, a devastating tornado with 150 mph winds rampaged through Clarksville, Tennessee, striking Sydney Moore’s household. Moore and her husband were separated from their baby, Lord, amid the chaos.<br><br>

                After the tornado calmed and they returned to the wreckage, the parents found Lord in a tree not far from where their house once stood.<br><br>

                Sydney Moore: “It had to have been God. We found him laying in a tree, like somebody placed him in this tree. All he had was a gash on the side of his face.”<br><br>

                “We are told that he looked like he was placed on the tree gently,” she added. “Like an angel guided him safely to that spot.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Chinese scientists have demonstrated an “invisibility cloak,” unveiled at a virtual event called Super Night of Science.<br><br>

                The demonstration involved a man and two assistants, who showed how the cloak could make the lower half of his body disappear.<br><br>

                The cloak works by manipulating light with specialized materials, creating an illusion of invisibility.<br><br>

                This tech has sparked a mix of skepticism and awe on social media.<br><br>

                One user on X: “China unveiled an actual, real life invisibility cloak. Which means they have had it for years now and maxed out its usage. Because only an idiot would announce to the world they have invisibility cloaks.”

                For years, the singer-producer Akon has promised a real-life Wakanda in Senegal: a high-tech 2,000-acre metropolis announced in 2020 whose economy would be based around his “Akoin” cryptocurrency.<br><br>

                The community would feature skyscrapers, recording studios, and luxury resorts.<br><br>

                He was so confident that he said in an interview, “Africa is in a position where if African Americans take position now, every single African American would be a millionaire without even thinking twice because there’s nothing that’s not needed over there.”<br><br>

                Currently, however, the community looks like a barren farmland, replete with a few goats and huts.<br><br>

                Additionally, Akon’s former business partner has since sued him, alleging the city plans had all the “red flags” of a ponzi scheme.<br><br>

                Akon denies the allegations, emphasizing in 2022 that plans are “100,000% moving.”<br><br>

                Canada is facing a reversal in immigration trends due to the high cost of living and rental shortages.<br><br>

                Statistics Canada reports a steady rise in emigration, with 42,000 individuals leaving in the first half of 2023, adding to significant numbers in 2021 and 2022.<br><br>

                Additionally, many immigrants are considering relocating to other countries or returning home.<br><br>

                The high costs are cited as primary reasons for this trend, with reports showing about 60% of household income needed for home ownership, which rises to 98% in Vancouver and 80% in Toronto.<br><br>

                For instance, Cara, 25, who came to Canada in 2022 as a refugee from Hong Kong, now pays C$650 ($474) in monthly rent for a single-room basement apartment in Scarborough in eastern Toronto, which is about 30% of her monthly take-home salary.<br><br>

                "I never realized that living in a Western country, you can only afford renting a room in the basement," she said.

                Nightclubs in Japan are reportedly luring women to rack up millions of yen in debt at the clubs and then making them enter sex work to pay the debt off.<br><br>

                These clubs, known as host clubs, use handsome young men to act as promoters and find naive women on dating apps. The women go to these clubs to chat and flirt with young men, ordering expensive drinks in the process, ultimately sending them into debt.<br><br>

                Hidemori Gen, who runs a center for these victims, says he’s seen a drastic rise in women who have been coerced into sex work to pay for their tabs. In the past five months alone, he’s had 300 consultations, mostly from embarrassed parents.<br><br>

                One 24-year-old was a promising medical student before she met an attractive male medical student on a dating app who lured her into a club. Since then, she’s amassed millions of yen in debt, dropped out of college, and now works in Japan’s commercial sex industry.<br><br>

                Gen: “We are talking about intelligent women with promising futures who become entrapped. Host clubs operate like cults. It’s a vicious business model that is no different from human trafficking. Host clubs are not selling champagne - they’re selling women’s bodies.”

                In a new study, researchers found that when the drug is combined with another cancer treatment called cetuximab, 62% of patients with tumors caused by a mutation in the KRAS gene saw their tumors either completely eradicated or reduced in size.<br><br>

                When used on its own, the pill yields a 35.9% positive response rate and is overall twenty times more effective than other treatments that also target the same cancer.<br><br>

                Because the kind of cancer that this pill targets is commonly tested for, doctors could quickly identify the patients that would benefit, providing immediate and potentially life-saving relief.

                In the latest example of we are living in a “Black Mirror” episode, a developer has released what he’s describing as “the future of AI Romantic Companionship” on iOS and Android.<br><br>

                Known as “Digi,” the AI takes the form of an animated, Disney-like character, which users can fully customize.<br><br>

                In a video posted on X to illustrate the AI, an animated woman with ginger hair, brown hair, and voluptuous titties looks directly at the user as if they were on a date together and says, “It was so nice talking to you today. Honestly, I’ve never met anyone like you.”<br><br>

                The scene of these dates can differ, from a bright restaurant in the middle of the afternoon to a dark, emo environment.<br><br>

                The developer of the AI, whose bio notes he’s “building AI romantic companions,” says the app features “a unique style that eliminates the uncanny valley, while also feeling real, human, and sexy. This has never been done before with Disney or Pixar characters, so we're very excited we could make it work for the first time in history.”<br><br>

                There are four voices available, with twenty expected by the end of January. Users can specialize their companions with AI-generated backstories, such as Zara, the traditional girl—”an aspiring homemaker with a deep commitment to family and community values”—or Raven, the Goth.<br><br>

                Reactions to the AI have been mixed, with some praising the technology behind it while others worry this will only accelerate trends such as loneliness and declining birth rates.<br><br>

                One user wrote: “This is one thing I hate about capitalism, we all know this isn't going to be a net societal good, but because of the incessant demands for profit expansion and need for new ROIs, this is invented regardless.”

                Research published in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition finds that since the 1940s, essential minerals and vitamins in crops have decreased drastically, including a 50% reduction in iron.<br><br>

                The researchers compared data on the contents of fruits and vegetables measured in 1940 and in 2019, finding that the amount of sodium, iron, copper, and magnesium have all significantly declined.<br><br>

                There’s one major reason for this trend: the Green Revolution in farming, which began around the 1960s. During this time, crops started being cross-bred to produce high-yielding varieties like wheat and rice. While this led to more crops overall, the crops themselves had a lower relative mineral content.<br><br>

                This revolution has now produced worldwide “micronutrient malnutrition.” For example, 42% of children under 5 and 40% of pregnant women suffer from a lack of vitamins, according to the World Health Organization.

                Scientists are the closest they’ve ever been to reversing the process of dying after they discovered exactly where the brain’s “wave of death” begins.<br><br>

                Speaking to The Daily Mail, these scientists say they’ve figured out when chemicals sweep through the brain, beginning a process that ends in death.<br><br>

                Séverine Mahon, a neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute in France: “Our work shows that dying (and not death) is not an event but a 'long' process that can be reversed up to a certain point. But we don't yet know exactly where the point of no return lies.”<br><br>

                Essentially, the process involves cells and regions shutting down in different ways and emitting special signals, and scientists have yet to pinpoint all of them.<br><br>

                Still, understanding the mechanisms behind the “wave of death” helps researchers develop drugs and treatments to prevent brain damage and brings scientists one step closer to a “holy grail” treatment that reverses death.

                Israeli forces accidentally killed three hostages of Hamas during combat in Gaza.<br><br>

                Jewish hostages Samer Talalka, Yotam Haim, and Alon Shamriz were mistaken for threats.<br><br>

                Israel Defense Forces: “The IDF emphasizes that this is an active combat zone in which ongoing fighting over the last few days has occurred. Immediate lessons from the event have been learned, which have been passed on to all IDF troops in the field. The IDF expresses deep remorse over the tragic incident and sends the families its heartfelt condolences. Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home.”<br><br>

                Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli prime minister: “Together with the entire people of Israel, I bow my head in deep sorrow and mourn the fall of three of our dear sons who were kidnapped. My heart goes out to the grieving families in their difficult time.”<br><br>

                The Israeli government claims there are still 137 hostages being held by Hamas.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Tech tycoon Bryan Johnson is on a mission to have the body of a pristine 18-year-old, and this quest involves a meticulous, Patrick Bateman-esque $2 million routine.<br><br>

                Johnson’s routine includes waking up at 5AM, a 1-hour exercise regimen, 5 hours of “concentrated thought,” 111 supplements, a 2,250-calorie vegan diet, daily health tests, as well as a strict sleep routine where he’s hooked up to a nighttime erection counting machine.<br><br>

                Additionally, the routine mandates “scheduled sex,” no small talk, and an 11AM dinner.<br><br>

                Johnson says he’s “tried to date,” but his commitment to his grind has unfortunately scared women away.<br><br>

                He made news in November for undergoing shock therapy on his penis to get “erections of an 18-year-old,” a procedure that he says is “painful” but well worth it.

                We won’t bore you with the details, but this is yet another example of China capturing infrastructure in not just Brazil but around the world.<br><br>

                From Saudi Arabia to Sierre Leone, China has only accelerated its investments in other countries, exerting its influence against the West, which is increasingly seen as hostile by many developing countries.<br><br>

                In Brazil particularly, China has quickly become a close partner, investing in transmission lines from the Amazon and importing Brazilian goods, for instance. China and Brazil are also both members of BRICS.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                As we reported just two days ago, Twitch updated its policies to allow “artistic” nudity, including content that “deliberately highlights breasts, buttocks, or pelvic region” and dances like twerking and pole dancing.<br><br>

                However, the live-stream gaming platform (if we can even call it that anymore) has since repealed the policy after critics questioned if it is now just a full-fledged porn website.<br><br>

                In a press release, the website wrote: “Upon reflection, we have decided that we went too far with this change. Effective today, we are rolling back the artistic nudity changes. Moving forward, depictions of real or fictional nudity won’t be allowed on Twitch, regardless of the medium.”<br><br>

                Many speculate that Twitch was pressured by advertisers to repeal this policy.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                New research on Spanish children born during or just before the COVID lockdowns finds that they developed more slowly than children born before.<br><br>

                Specifically, the children born during or just before the lockdowns are developing language skills at a slower rate, using fewer distinct words and less complex phrases.<br><br>

                These children barely reached the 40th percentile in vocabulary and sentence complexity, compared to the other group of children scoring in the 50th percentile.<br><br>

                Researchers attribute this difference to children having limited social experiences during lockdowns. Additionally, the lockdowns introduced new challenges, such as wearing masks, that hindered children’s ability to speak and hear other people.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Americans over 65 will account for almost 60% of all labor force growth over the next decade, a rate higher than ever.<br><br>

                The earnings of these workers made up 7% of all wages and salaries paid by employers this year, compared to just 2% in the 1980s.<br><br>

                Pew Research Center notes that these boomers are also working more hours than in past decades, partly because there are now more “age-friendly” jobs that have more flexibility and less physical labor.<br><br>

                This coincides with another striking trend: an increasing number of young workers, particularly young men, are dropping out of the workforce. According to U.S. data, 7.2 million men of prime working age have stopped working and aren’t seeking employment.<br><br>

                It’s unclear what exactly is driving that trend, but if it accelerates, more older workers may have to remain in the workforce.

                The flare released a burst of radiation toward Earth, spectacularly caught on video by NASA.<br><br>

                SpaceWeather.com reports that it “caused a deep shortwave radio blackout over the Americas.”<br><br>

                Some scientists have warned for years that the sun is entering a more active time, with the worst-case scenario being an “internet apocalypse” that could wipe out the internet for weeks or months.<br><br>

                Professor Peter Becker of George Mason University, in November: “The internet has come of age during a time when the sun has been relatively quiet, and now it's entering a more active time. It's the first time in human history that there's been an intersection of increased solar activity with our dependence on the internet and our global economic dependence on the internet.”

                Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, won the 2023 ULI Prize for Visionaries in Urban Development, one of the most prestigious awards in the world for city planning.<br><br>

                Hidalgo is praised for her efforts to actualize a more welcoming and sustainable vision of Paris through policies like reducing the city’s carbon emissions by 40% and increasing the amount of affordable housing. In her Urban Plan, she limits the height of new buildings to twelve stories to reduce the environmental toll.<br><br>

                Key projects she has undertaken include improving pedestrian traffic, overseeing the creation of an app that monitors thermal comfort, and advancing the idea of a fifteen-minute city, of which she has been a key proponent. Hidalgo hopes to eliminate non-essential traffic from the Paris center before the 2024 Olympic Games.<br><br>
                
                Hidalgo: “Working with a diverse group of public and private sector experts as well as engaged residents of Paris, we have been able to create a city that translates this vision into reality. Together, we’ve championed initiatives to enhance walkability, diminish reliance on automobiles, and fortify our commitment to fostering sustainable communities both within and beyond the city limits. This recognition serves as a testament to the collective efforts that have propelled Paris towards a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban landscape.”

                U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna has introduced a landmark bill that would ban stock trading in Congress—a change activists have been demanding for decades.
                In a post on X, the Democrat representative wrote: “All I want for Christmas is to clean up the corruption in Congress.”<br><br>

                His bill would ban stock trading for members of Congress, ban lobbyist and PAC donations, and prohibit members from becoming lobbyists.<br><br>

                Additionally, the piece of legislation would enact a term limit for Congress and the Supreme Court and enforce a “code of ethics” for the latter.<br><br>

                This is not the first bill that hopes to root out insider trading—in January, Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced the PELOSI Act, named after Nancy Pelosi, who has been frequently accused of insider trading.<br><br>

                Hawley’s bill was unable to pass, so time will tell if Khanna has similar fortunes. Still, there is bipartisan support for this much-requested change.

                A Christian man has smashed and beheaded a Satanic shrine erected in the Iowa Capitol after the altar drew backlash from Iowans.<br><br>

                The shrine, depicting Baphomet surrounded by candles while holding a pentacle, was installed by the Satanic Temple of Iowa with permission from the government. It was placed directly next to displays of the Nativity.<br><br>

                Michael Cassidy, a Christian and former military officer, decapitated the statue and then discarded the head in a trash can.<br><br>

                Speaking to The Sentinel, Cassidy said he destroyed the altar to “awaken Christians to the anti-Christian acts promoted by our government.”<br><br>

                Cassidy: “The world may tell Christians to submissively accept the legitimization of Satan, but none of the founders would have considered government sanction of Satanic altars inside Capitol buildings as protected by the First Amendment. Anti-Christian values have steadily been mainstreamed more and more in recent decades, and Christians have largely acted like the proverbial frog in the boiling pot of water.”<br><br>

                He turned himself into police after the incident and has already obtained legal representation.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Earlier this month, about 1,200 tons of sardines and mackerel floated on the shores of Japan, reaching over half a mile.<br><br>

                “I’ve never seen anything like this before,” a fisher who worked in the area for 25 years said.<br><br>

                Locals hastily collected the fish, worrying that their carcasses would lower the oxygen content of the water and damage the environment.<br><br>

                Immediately, speculation brewed, connecting the hordes of dead fish to Japan releasing treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in October.<br><br>

                Government officials rejected these claims, referring to them as “unsubstantiated information.” But they remain mystified as to what could be causing this.<br><br>

                “The cause is unknown at the moment,” a fishery official told a newspaper. “We plan to sample the seawater at the site and examine it to uncover the cause.”<br><br>

                When Japan released the treated nuclear power plant water, China banned all seafood from the country and blasted Tokyo for harming the waters. Beijing has since been accused of hypocrisy, as its nuclear plants also routinely pump wastewater.

                A new Business Insider survey of 1,800 Americans finds that 28% of respondents between the ages of 18 and 26 said they “somewhat or strongly preferred” socialism over capitalism—the most of any generation.<br><br>

                Only 29% of that group said they prefer capitalism, despite that being the system closest to America’s.<br><br>

                The remainder said they didn’t have a preference or weren’t sure.<br><br>

                One 19-year-old girl told Business Insider: “Seeing corporate greed in the news every single day makes it understandable that we would want something better. I don't necessarily think that means socialism. I think that means making sure the system that we're working under is really doing its best to support as many people as possible.”<br><br>

                Another member of Gen Z said: “A system that centers overproduction, overconsumption, and perpetual growth is not sustainable. From increasing oil development in the midst of a climate crisis to jacking up food and energy costs, there's only a matter of time before we collectively agree that this setup cannot persist.”<br><br>

                It’s not difficult to see where they’re coming from. Housing is the least affordable it’s been in four decades; polls have consistently found a majority of Americans struggle with paying for healthcare; and college tuition is at an all-time high. All of this unfolds while the divide between the rich and poor enlarges and the middle class shrinks.<br><br>

                Still, many in Gen Z are optimistic, with one remarking, “The arc of history is a long arc, but so far, the presumption that eventually things will get better has always been right.”

                The NBA has suspended Draymond Green indefinitely, citing a “repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts.”<br><br>

                The suspension came after the Golden State Warriors forward slapped Jusuf Nurkić across the face during a game on Tuesday, resulting in Green receiving a flagrant foul 2 and an ejection for the third time this season.<br><br>

                After this incident, Green apologized: “I am not one to apologize for things I mean to do, but I do apologize to Jusuf because I didn't intend to hit him. I sell calls with my arms ... so I was selling the call ... and I swung and unfortunately I hit him.”<br><br>

                The other two ejections came when he picked up two technical fouls against the Cavaliers in November and put Rudy Gobert in a headlock just three days after.<br><br>

                To fulfill the conditions of this suspension, Green “will be required to meet certain league and team conditions before he returns to play,” the NBA said.<br><br>

                This is already Green’s second suspension this season, and his coach, Steve Kerr, has made it clear his absence will be felt: “We need him. We need Draymond. He knows that. We've talked to him. He's got to find a way to keep his poise and be out there for his teammates.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Silicon Valley billionaires are backing a new investment fund launched today that aims to develop libertarian societies called “Network States.”<br><br>

                The basic idea for these societies is that the West has irrevocably declined, starting with the birth of a Leviathan-esque state that disempowered visionaries with predatory banking, regulations, and an adversarial journalism class.<br><br>

                The solution, therefore, is for these visionaries to reclaim power over these institutions, which will be accomplished through the Internet and digital currencies like Bitcoin.<br><br>

                Billionaires supporting this idea include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Peter Thiel, and venture capitalist Fred Wilson.<br><br>

                These societies will initially emerge online and be based on “Internet values” like open source and peer-to-peer, but the hope is that they become communities in the real world and even create new cities, with institutions run by private companies.<br><br>

                Examples of these communities that already exist include a car-free community in Tempe, Arizona, and the Peter Thiel-backed Próspera in Honduras.<br><br>

                Balaji Srinivasa, an investor who launched the fund today: “Suppose you found a new startup society like Culdesac on the basis of car-free living…which is an innovation in parallel transportation. You could import a parallel educational service to improve your K-12 education, or a parallel medical service to complement your societal innovation in transportation.”

                Critic: “Please help me understand. Why do I have to spend the night without any accommodations in Baltimore because an oversized person didn’t purchase a second ticket?”<br><br>

                Jae’lynn Chaney, Plus-Sized Travel Expert: “Super fat is how we identify. There’s a spectrum of fatness. And as a ‘super fat’ individual you start needing different accommodations. The Southwest customer size policy helps many travelers offset the disproportionate costs that we incur because of needing extra room.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A federal jury in San Francisco on Monday found that Google’s app store was an illegal monopoly that the company used to prevent competition.<br><br>

                This comes just months after Google settled with a coalition of state attorneys general, who also alleged Google’s store was breaking antitrust laws.<br><br>

                In South Korea and the Netherlands, legal challenges have been mounted against the 30% fees that Google and Apple charge on app store transactions.<br><br>

                Apple and Google make billions of dollars a year funneling users to make purchases through their app stores, and these legal challenges could threaten their dominance for the first time.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A graph depicting how couples met in the U.S. from 1950 to 2020 has gone viral on social media, shocking users with the changes over the years.<br><br>

                In 2020, less than 10% of American couples met through friends, compared to nearly 30% in 2010.<br><br>

                This decline corresponded with a rapid increase in U.S. couples meeting online, with over 50% in 2020, doubling from 2010.<br><br>

                Other ways couples meet, such as work, bars, school, neighbors, and college, have all declined as well, sinking all below 10%.<br><br>

                One user captioned the graph: “This is catastrophic.”<br><br>

                In 2023, 70% of couples met through online dating, according to Forbes.<br><br>

                This all comes as 45% of men aged 18 to 25 say they have never approached a woman in person.

                Dave Rubin, a washed-up podcaster who purchased both his children earlier this year, appeared on Bill Maher’s show, where he was grilled for his support for DeSantis as president.<br><br>

                Maher asked Rubin: “I assume if [Trump] is the nominee, we’ll vote for this.”<br><br>

                Rubin ignored the question, responding, “I want Ron DeSantis to be president—,” with Maher interrupting, “I know, but it’s going to be Trump.”<br><br>

                Rubin: “We don’t know.”<br><br>

                Maher: “So he’s going to make up 41 points?”<br><br>

                Rubin: “Well 41 points, I mean I look at these polls, I mean they’re like—”<br><br>

                Maher: “Okay, who’s lying now? You think DeSantis is going to beat Trump for the nomination?”<br><br>

                Many speculate Rubin is being paid by the DeSantis campaign, simply for the reason that no reasonable person would willingly support a man who wears heels to look taller.

                Bayen Dupree has over nine million followers on TikTok, where she uses her platform to educate people about Tourette’s.<br><br>

                Cuomo brought her on as a guest, asking her at the start of the interview, “What do you hope you can do by taking the risks that you take?”<br><br>

                Throughout the interview, Dupree had various bursts of expletives, so much so that Cuomo began laughing less than two minutes in.<br><br>

                “I obviously go to the gym and I wear headphones and that's also a very big factor in how… fuck off. Fuck Collin, fuck that bitch,” she said later on.<br><br>

                A member of parliament in Poland went viral yesterday for extinguishing a lit menorah in the country’s legislative building, and he has since explained his actions in a speech.<br><br>

                He emphasized that “there can be no place for acts of racist, tribal, wild, Talmudic cults.”<br><br>

                The parliament’s chairman then told the Honorable Braun that he had “seriously disturbed the peace or order,” and that if he insults “followers of other religions” again, he will be excluded from proceedings.<br><br>

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Architecture students at Penn State are using 3D printing to revitalize a city that has been in decline.<br><br>

                Oil City, Pennsylvania, is where innovations in petroleum began in the 1800s, turning the city into a bustling economic nexus.<br><br>

                Today, however, the oil companies that supported the town’s economy and infrastructure in its early days have moved away, leaving the town in a gradual state of decline.<br><br>

                Selina Pedi-Smith, a community developer in the region: “The smaller towns have been in steady decline since then.”<br><br>

                In a mission to revitalize the city, Pedi-Smith reached out to the architecture school at Penn State.<br><br>

                One of Penn State’s initiatives right now is to use concrete to 3D print sustainable, affordable housing, and Pedi-Smith saw that technology as the perfect approach to reviving Oil City.<br><br>

                The school identified a plot of land in the city to be used as a case study in a class for how 3D-printed concrete homes could bolster the economy.<br><br>

                Students were divided into groups, with each creating different designs, all focusing on community engagement and tourism.<br><br>

                They presented their final designs to a jury of reviewers in December, and Pedi-Smith said she will take inspiration from each project as she continues her efforts to restore the city.<br><br>

                Trevor Klatt, student: “Resilient housing is very important, especially in a housing crisis that is continuously getting worse. We always need more houses.”
