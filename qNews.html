            <p class="paragraphr">
                A town leader in northern Israel argued the Gaza Strip should be leveled and transformed into a museum like Auschwitz in Poland.<br><br>
                
                David Azoulai, Metula council chief, said in a radio interview: “The entire Gaza Strip should be emptied and leveled flat, just like Auschwitz. Let it become a museum, showcasing the capabilities of the state of Israel and dissuading anyone from living in the Gaza Strip. This is what must be done to give them a visual representation.”<br><br>

                He added that Palestinians should be forced into Lebanese refugee camps: “Tell everyone in Gaza to go to the beaches. Navy ships should load the terrorists onto the shores of Lebanon.”<br><br>

                Over 19,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s intrusion in Gaza, with 54,450 wounded. (18 12 23)

            <h3 class="hecho">Report: Meta Bans Pro-Palestine Views</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                In a new report, Human Rights Watch accuses Facebook and Instagram parent Meta of “systemic and global” censorship of pro-Palestinian content since the war's onset on October 7.<br><br>

                The report cites over 1,000 instances, including post removals, account bans, interaction restrictions, and “shadow banning” that reduces visibility and reach.<br><br>

                Meta has denied the allegations, calling the systemic censorship claim “misleading.” It cited its human rights due diligence and the complexity of content moderation in a polarized conflict. Still, the company’s oversight board admitted errors, reinstating two significant videos depicting scenes from the war.<br><br>

                The claims come as TikTok, seen as a competitor to Meta, is facing opposite allegations: that it favors pro-Palestinian content. Earlier this month, reports emerged that Jewish tech executives met with TikTok’s CEO to discuss the bias concerns. Some, such as Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, have gone so far as to say that spending time on TikTok increases someone’s likelihood of being “antisemitic” to a significant extent.

            <h3 class="hecho">Palestinian Christians Fear Genocide</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Christians living in Gaza fear “extinction” amid Israel’s military actions.<br><br>

                In 2007, about 3,000 Palestinian Christians lived in Gaza. Now, there are only about 800 to 1,000.<br><br>

                Mitri Raheb, pastor and founder of Dar al-Kalima University in Bethlehem: “I’m not sure if they will survive the Israeli bombing, and even if they survive, I think many of them will want to emigrate,” adding that the Christian community is “under threat of extinction.”<br><br>

                Before the current conflict, the Christian community in Gaza was shrinking by 5% on an average year as young Gazans emigrated because of what they saw as oppressive Israeli restrictions.<br><br>

                Churches in the territory have not been spared by Israel—on October 19, the Saint Porphyrius Church was hit during an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, killing 18 people, including nine children, and injuring nearly 100 people.<br><br>

                Additionally, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced last week that an Israeli sniper murdered two Christian women inside a church in Gaza and that Israel fired rockets at a convent that cares for over 54 disabled people.<br><br>

                Pope Francis condemned the attacks: “I continue to receive very serious and painful news from Gaza. Unarmed civilians are subjected to bombings and shootings. And this even happened inside the parish complex of the Holy Family, where there are no terrorists, but families, children, sick and disabled people, nuns.”

            <p class="paragraphr">
                Activists have sent bottles into the Yellow Sea with flash drives containing Bible readings, hoping ocean currents carry them to North Korea, where Christmas has been banned since 2016.<br><br>

                The bottles, sent by members of the U.S.-based North Korean Freedom Coalition (NKFC), also each contain enough rice to feed a family of four for a week, a $1 bill, and North Korean music. The activists changed the lyrics from worshiping Kim Jong Un to praising God.<br><br>

                Suzanne Scholte, chairwoman of the NKFC: “We should be doing everything we can to get information into North Korea by land, by sea, and by air. Operation Truth is modeled after the Berlin Airlift, to get critical help to the starving people of North Korea.”<br><br>

                Scholte’s Christmas message included in the bottles says: “Christmas, which is celebrated all over the world on December 25th, marks the day when Jesus was born...Many of your ancestors also believed in Jesus. In fact, in 1907, in Pyongyang, there were so many Christians who believed in Jesus that Pyongyang became known as a Holy City. But when Kim II Sung came to power, he wanted North Koreans to worship him as a god, and not the one true God. So, he killed many Christian leaders, sent others to political prison camps, or banished them. He did all he could to kill the followers of Jesus Christ.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                A new study reveals students would be willing to pay $28 to have their peers, including themselves, deactivate TikTok and Instagram.<br><br>

                However, those students say they would need to be paid $59 to deactivate TikTok and $47 to deactivateInstagram  if their peers were to continue using their accounts.<br><br>
                
                Taken together, these results imply the existence of a “social media trap” for a large share of consumers,  whose utility from the platforms is negative but would have been even more negative if they didn’t usesocial  media.<br><br>

            <h3 class="hecho">Analyst: AI Girlfriends Pose Threat</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                These virtual companions are customizable down to the finest detail and offer an idealized partnership. As AI technology advances, the virtual beings are becoming increasingly lifelike, mastering human interactions and emotions, and offering a level of perfection that real relationships can't compete with.<br><br>

                Liberty Vittert, professor of data science: “They look like real people and are shockingly good when it comes to replicating human interactions. Physical AI robots that can satisfy humans emotionally and sexually will become a stark reality in less than ten years. It’s always this perfect relationship for lonely single men, which is very dangerous because it further isolates them from real human connections.”<br><br>

                Analysts note that the emergence of AI girlfriends comes as birthrates are at a historical low and loneliness is already at an all-time high. Additionally, men are already interacting with women less and less—a poll from earlier this year found that 59% of men aged 18 to 25 have not approached a woman in the past year.

            <h3 class="hecho">Putin Now Serious About Ending War</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Putin is showing a new willingness to negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine, The New York Times reports.<br><br>

                The report cites Russian and American sources who say Putin is open to a ceasefire for the first time, entailing freezing of all frontline fighting. American officials note Putin is “satisfied with Russia’s captured territory and ready for an armistice.”<br><br>

                The Russian president wishes to enter negotiations on the basis that Crimea and the Donbass would be fully recognized as Russian territory. Until recently, the West saw this as an impossibility, but reports suggest that U.S. and European officials are warming to the idea, admitting that Moscow has “won” the conflict.<br><br>

                The report comes after the White House warned last week that aid to Ukraine will run out unless Congress approves a new spending bill. The U.S. has approved over $110 billion for the eastern European country since the conflict began in February 2022.

            <h3 class="hecho">New Tiny Robots Can Treat Disease</h3>
            <p class="paragraphr">
                Scientists from Tufts and Harvard have created microscopic robots, termed "anthrobots," that they hope could one day travel around bodies and heal damaged cells.<br><br>

                The most striking part of these robots: they’re made using human lung cells.<br><br>

                The discovery came when the scientists were tinkering with cilia, small hair-like structures on cell surfaces, and noticed they began moving when they faced outwards—so they applied that principle to create moving robots from lung cells.<br><br>

                When these robots were placed on damaged neuron cells, new cell growth was encouraged.<br><br>

                The scientists aren’t quite sure how cell regeneration will work, but they believe the robots could clear blocked arteries, repair spinal cords, identify cancer cells, or deliver drugs to specific parts of the body.<br><br>

                They come in various sizes, with some as small as the width of a human hair.<br><br>

                The development of this futuristic technology comes as the FDA has already approved over 500 medical AI algorithms that are helping to diagnose and treat patients.

            <p class="paragraphr">
                South Korean police are warning that a new, youngster type of criminal has emerged, shifting away from violence toward fraud and gambling crimes.<br><br>

                Known as “MZ gangsters,” these criminals are under 30 and were most of the 1,183 arrested between August and December. Law enforcement notes these “gangsters” prioritize profit and partnerships over older, faction-based criminal structures, with over 40% of the charges involving “intricate/business-type illegal activities," such as running online gambling sites.<br><br>

                While traditional mafia-style groups have diminished due to decades of crackdowns, foreign syndicates like the Triads, Yakuza, and Russian mafia continue to influence the country's criminal landscape.
